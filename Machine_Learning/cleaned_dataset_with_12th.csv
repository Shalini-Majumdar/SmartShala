,,,CHAPTER 2- SYSTEMATICS OF LIVING ORGANISMS,"Introduction to Systematics

Systematics is the branch of biology that deals with the classification, naming, and evolutionary relationships of organisms. It helps in understanding the diversity of life and organizing species into a structured framework.

Concept of Systematics

Systematics includes taxonomy (identification, classification, and naming of organisms) and phylogenetics (evolutionary relationships among species).

Taxonomy

Taxonomy is the science of classification based on similarities and differences among organisms. It involves three main classification types:

Artificial Classification – Based on a few morphological features (e.g., Aristotle’s classification).

Natural Classification – Based on multiple characteristics, including anatomy and physiology.

Phylogenetic Classification – Based on evolutionary history and genetic relationships.

Three Domains of Life

The classification of organisms is divided into three major domains:

Domain Archaea – Includes prokaryotic microorganisms that survive in extreme environments.

Domain Bacteria – Includes common prokaryotes found in diverse environments.

Domain Eukarya – Includes all eukaryotic organisms, such as plants, fungi, and animals.

Advanced Taxonomic Concepts

Chemotaxonomy – Classification based on biochemical compounds present in organisms.

Numerical Taxonomy – Uses statistical and mathematical methods for classification.

Cladogram – A branching diagram representing evolutionary relationships.

Phylogeny – Study of evolutionary history and relationships among organisms.

DNA Barcoding – Uses genetic sequences to identify species accurately.

Taxonomic Hierarchy: Unit of Classification

Taxonomic hierarchy is a system where organisms are ranked into successive levels. The main units of classification include:

Species – A group of organisms capable of interbreeding.

Genus – A group of closely related species.

Family – A group of related genera.

Order – A collection of related families.

Class – Includes related orders.

Phylum/Division – Contains related classes.

Kingdom – Broadest classification level.

Nomenclature

Binomial Nomenclature

Binomial nomenclature is the two-part scientific naming system developed by Carolus Linnaeus.

Need for Binomial Nomenclature – Ensures standardization and avoids confusion due to local names.

Universal Rules of Binomial Nomenclature:

Scientific names are in Latin.

The genus name starts with a capital letter, and the species name is in lowercase.

Names are italicized when printed and underlined when handwritten.

Scientific Names of Some Common Organisms

Human – Homo sapiens

Tiger – Panthera tigris

Mango – Mangifera indica

Importance and Drawbacks of Binomial Nomenclature

Importance: Ensures consistency and avoids ambiguity in naming species.
Drawbacks: Some names are complex and difficult to remember.

Salient Features of Five Kingdoms

Introduction to Kingdom Plantae

The Kingdom Plantae includes all photosynthetic, multicellular, eukaryotic organisms commonly referred to as plants. These organisms play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by producing oxygen and serving as the primary source of food in the biosphere. Plants exhibit a wide range of diversity and are classified based on morphological and reproductive characteristics.

Classification of Kingdom Plantae

Plants are classified into two major groups based on their reproductive structures:

Cryptogams (Non-seed Bearing Plants) - These plants do not produce seeds and reproduce via spores. They include Thallophyta, Bryophyta, and Pteridophyta.

Phanerogams (Seed-bearing Plants) - These plants produce seeds and have well-developed reproductive structures. They include Gymnosperms and Angiosperms.

Salient Features of Major Plant Groups Under Cryptogams

1. Division: Thallophyta

These are simple plants with no true roots, stems, or leaves.

They are commonly known as algae and are primarily aquatic.

They reproduce via spores.

Classes of Thallophyta:

Chlorophyceae (Green Algae)

Contain chlorophyll a and b.

Store food in the form of starch.

Example: Chlamydomonas, Spirogyra.

Phaeophyceae (Brown Algae)

Contain chlorophyll a, c, and fucoxanthin (brown pigment).

Store food as laminarin and mannitol.

Example: Fucus, Laminaria.

Rhodophyceae (Red Algae)

Contain chlorophyll a, d, and phycoerythrin (red pigment).

Store food as floridean starch.

Example: Gelidium, Gracilaria.

2. Division: Bryophyta (Moss Plants)

Known as amphibians of the plant kingdom as they require water for fertilization.

Lack vascular tissues but show differentiation into stem-like and leaf-like structures.

Reproduce through spores.

Classes of Bryophyta:

Liverworts (Hepaticeae)

Body is thalloid and dorsiventral.

Reproduce via gemmae and spores.

Example: Marchantia.

Usually have needle-like leaves and deep root systems.

Mostly perennial and woody.

Example: Pinus, Cycas, Ginkgo.

2. Angiospermae (Enclosed Seed Plants)

Seeds are enclosed within a fruit.

Show advanced reproductive structures (flowers).

Exhibit double fertilization.

Subdivisions of Angiosperms:

Cell: The Structural and Functional Unit of Life
Cells are the basic units of structure and function in all living organisms. They form the foundation of life, performing essential biological processes. The concept of cells being the fundamental unit of life was first proposed after the development of microscopes, leading to the discovery of cells.

Discovery of Cells
The discovery of cells dates back to 1665, when Robert Hooke observed cork cells under a microscope and coined the term ""cell."" Later, Anton van Leeuwenhoek improved the microscope and observed living cells, including bacteria and protozoa.

The Cell Theory, proposed by Schleiden and Schwann (1838-1839) and later modified by Rudolf Virchow (1855), states that:

All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
The cell is the basic unit of life.
All cells arise from pre-existing cells.
Types of Cells
Cells can be broadly classified into three categories:

1. Prokaryotic Cells
Prokaryotic cells are simple, primitive cells without a well-defined nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.
Their genetic material (DNA) is present in a region called the nucleoid.
They include bacteria and archaea.
2. Eukaryotic Cells
Eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
They are more complex than prokaryotic cells.
Found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists.
3. Mesokaryotic Cells
These cells show characteristics of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
They have a well-defined nucleus but lack true membrane-bound organelles.
Dinoflagellates are an example.
Components of Eukaryotic Cells
Eukaryotic cells contain various components that perform specific functions. These can be classified into three major parts:

1. Cell Envelope (Outer Boundary)
Cell Wall
Present in plant cells, fungi, and bacteria but absent in animal cells.
Composed of cellulose (plants), chitin (fungi), or peptidoglycan (bacteria).
Provides structural support and protection.
Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane/Biomembrane)
A selectively permeable membrane that regulates the entry and exit of substances.
Composed of lipid bilayers with embedded proteins (Fluid Mosaic Model).
Functions in cell communication and transport.
2. Cytoplasmic Structures (Cellular Organelles)
Cytoplasm
Gel-like substance that fills the cell, providing a medium for biochemical reactions.
Contains organelles, enzymes, and ions.
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
A network of membranes involved in transport and synthesis.
Two types:
Rough ER (RER) – Studded with ribosomes, involved in protein synthesis.
Smooth ER (SER) – Lacks ribosomes, involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification.
Golgi Complex
A stack of membrane-bound vesicles responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids.
Forms lysosomes and secretory vesicles.
Lysosomes
Membrane-bound sacs containing digestive enzymes (hydrolytic enzymes).
Function in intracellular digestion and waste removal.
Vacuoles
Fluid-filled sacs that store nutrients, waste, and water.
Large central vacuole in plant cells provides turgor pressure.
Glyoxysomes
Specialized peroxisomes found in plant cells.
Play a role in fat metabolism during seed germination.
Mitochondria (Singular: Mitochondrion)
""Powerhouse of the cell"" responsible for ATP (energy) production.
Have a double membrane and their own DNA, allowing them to self-replicate.
Carry out cellular respiration.
Plastids
Found in plant cells and some protists.
Three types:
Chloroplasts – Contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis.
Chromoplasts – Contain pigments (red, yellow, orange) in flowers/fruits.
Leucoplasts – Store starch, proteins, or fats.
Ribosomes
Small, non-membrane-bound organelles responsible for protein synthesis.
Found freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the Rough ER.
Nucleus
The control center of the cell containing genetic material (DNA).
Enclosed by the nuclear membrane.
Contains the nucleolus, which synthesizes ribosomes.
Cytoskeleton
A network of protein filaments (microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments).
Provides cell shape, support, and movement.",7,1000,"Cell

Introduction to Cell Division

Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce to form new cells. It is essential for growth, repair, and reproduction in all living organisms. The two primary types of cell division are mitosis and meiosis.

Amitosis (Direct Cell Division)

Amitosis is a simple type of cell division where the nucleus divides directly without the formation of chromosomes. It occurs in unicellular organisms and some specialized cells in multicellular organisms.

Mitosis

Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, maintaining the chromosome number of the parent cell. It is essential for growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction.

Closed and Open Mitosis

Closed Mitosis: Occurs within the nucleus without nuclear envelope breakdown.

Open Mitosis: The nuclear envelope dissolves, allowing spindle fibers to interact with chromosomes.

Phases of Mitosis

Prophase – Chromosomes condense, spindle fibers form, and the nuclear envelope breaks down.

Metaphase – Chromosomes align at the cell’s equator.

Anaphase – Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.

Telophase – Nuclear membranes reform around each set of chromosomes.

Cytokinesis

Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two separate daughter cells.

Significance of Mitosis

Ensures genetic stability by producing identical cells.

Helps in the growth and development of multicellular organisms.

Aids in tissue repair and regeneration.

Supports asexual reproduction in certain organisms.

Meiosis

Meiosis is a specialized cell division that produces gametes (sperm and egg cells) with half the chromosome number, ensuring genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms.

Meiosis I – Reduction Division

The first meiotic division reduces the chromosome number by half.

Prophase I – Chromosomes condense, homologous chromosomes pair up, and crossing over occurs. It has five sub-stages:

Zygotene – Homologous chromosomes begin pairing.

Pachytene – Crossing over (exchange of genetic material) occurs.

Diplotene – Homologous chromosomes start separating but remain connected at chiasmata.

Diakinesis – Chromosomes are fully condensed, and nuclear membrane breakdown begins.

Metaphase I – Homologous chromosome pairs align at the cell’s equator.

Anaphase I – Homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles.

Telophase I – Two haploid daughter cells form with half the chromosome number.

Cytokinesis I – Division of the cytoplasm, forming two haploid cells.

Meiosis II – Homotypic Division

The second meiotic division resembles mitosis but maintains the haploid state.

Prophase II – Chromosomes condense again in both daughter cells.

Metaphase II – Chromosomes align at the equator.

Anaphase II – Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.

Telophase II – Nuclear membranes reform, resulting in four haploid cells.

Cytokinesis II – The final cytoplasmic division produces four non-identical haploid cells.

Significance of Meiosis

Maintains a stable chromosome number across generations.

Introduces genetic variation through recombination and independent assortment.

Essential for sexual reproduction.

Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is the series of events a cell undergoes leading to its division and duplication. It consists of the following phases:

G1 Phase – Cell growth and preparation for DNA replication.

S Phase – DNA replication occurs.

G2 Phase – Preparation for mitosis, including protein synthesis.

M Phase – Mitosis and cytokinesis take place.

G0 Phase – A resting state where cells exit the cycle temporarily or permanently.

Death of a Cell

Cells may die due to natural causes or external factors:

Apoptosis – Programmed cell death essential for development and homeostasis.

Necrosis – Uncontrolled cell death due to injury or disease.

Contain chlorophyll, a pigment that absorbs light energy.

Two predominant types of chlorophylls: Chlorophyll-a and Chlorophyll-b.

Nature of Light

Light has a dual nature: acts as both particles (photons) and waves.

Corpuscular nature: Light is made up of particles.

Wave nature: Light behaves as a wave with properties like wavelength and frequency.

Particle nature: Light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons.

Types of Light Optics

,,,CHAPTER 13- RESPIRATION AND ENERGY TRANSFER,"Chapter 13: Respiration and Energy Transfer

Introduction

Respiration is a biochemical process that involves the breakdown of glucose to release energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). This energy is essential for various cellular activities, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and biosynthesis.

Why Do We Need Energy?

All living organisms require energy for vital functions such as movement, growth, reproduction, and maintaining homeostasis.

ATP is the universal energy currency of the cell.

Formation of ATP

ATP is formed through the process of cellular respiration by breaking down glucose.

The energy released from glucose is used to convert ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) into ATP.

Energy Requirements in Different Organisms

Animals need more energy than plants due to their active lifestyles.

Birds and Mammals need even more energy because they maintain a constant body temperature (endothermic organisms).

Types of Respiration

1. Aerobic Respiration

Requires oxygen.

Complete breakdown of glucose into CO₂, H₂O, and ATP.

Equation:


Occurs in mitochondria.

2. Anaerobic Respiration

Does not require oxygen.

Produces less energy.

Glucose is partially broken down into lactic acid (in animals) or ethanol and CO₂ (in plants and yeast).

3. Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA Cycle/Krebs Cycle)

Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.

Acetyl-CoA is further oxidized, producing NADH, FADH₂, ATP, and CO₂.

Net Yield: 2 ATP per glucose molecule.

4. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation

Occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Electrons from NADH and FADH₂ pass through the ETC.

Produces 34 ATP molecules.

5. Fermentation

A type of anaerobic respiration.

Produces ATP without oxygen.

Types of fermentation:

Lactic Acid Fermentation: Occurs in muscles during exercise.

Alcohol Fermentation: Occurs in yeast.

Acetic Acid Fermentation: Used in vinegar production.

Butyric Acid Fermentation: Occurs in some bacteria.

Advantages of Fermentation

Provides energy when oxygen is not available.

Used in industries (e.g., baking, brewing).

Respiratory Balance Sheet

Represents ATP production at each stage.

Total ATP Yield per Glucose: 38 ATP.

Amphibolic Pathways

Respiration is both catabolic (breakdown of glucose) and anabolic (formation of biomolecules from intermediates).

Utility of Stepwise Oxidation

Prevents energy loss as heat.

Ensures controlled energy release.

It is a long, muscular tube extending from the mouth to the anus.

Digestive Organs
Mouth and Buccal Cavity

Ingestion of food occurs here.
Contains teeth, tongue, and salivary glands.
The Salivary Glands

Secrete saliva, which contains salivary amylase to break down starch into maltose.

Helps in mechanical digestion (chewing).
Made of enamel, dentine, pulp, and cementum.
Types of Teeth

Incisors (cutting)
Canines (tearing)
Premolars (grinding)
Molars (crushing)
Tongue

Helps in tasting, swallowing, and speech.
Food Pipe/Oesophagus

Transports food from mouth to stomach through peristalsis.
The Stomach

Stores food and secretes gastric juice, which contains:
Pepsin (digests proteins)
HCl (kills bacteria, activates enzymes)
Mucus (protects stomach lining)
The Small Intestine

The primary site for digestion and absorption.
Contains three parts: Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum.
Receives secretions from pancreas and liver.
The Pancreas

Secretes pancreatic juice containing:
Trypsin (digests proteins)
Lipase (digests fats)

The Large Intestine

Absorbs water and forms feces.
Consists of the Caecum, Colon, and Rectum.
The Liver
Produces bile, which emulsifies fats.
Detoxifies harmful substances.
Physiology of Digestion
The digestive process involves:

Digestion in the Buccal Cavity
Salivary amylase converts starch into maltose.
Food is converted into a soft mass called bolus.
Digestion in the Stomach
Pepsin breaks down proteins into peptides.
HCl maintains the acidic pH for enzyme activity.
Digestion in the Small Intestine
Pancreatic juice acts on food:
Amylase → Starch → Maltose
Trypsin → Proteins → Peptides
Lipase → Fats → Fatty acids & glycerol
Intestinal juice further breaks down food.
Absorption of Food
Nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine via villi.
Assimilation of Food
Absorbed nutrients are transported to body cells for energy and growth.
Egestion of Food
Undigested food is expelled as feces through the anus.

Movements and Locomotion

Movements

Movement refers to the ability of an organism to change its position or shape. It plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, such as circulation, digestion, and locomotion.

Locomotion

Locomotion is the movement of an organism from one place to another using different types of body structures. This is necessary for food acquisition, escape from predators, and reproduction.

Types of Movements

Amoeboid Movement – Movement observed in amoebas and some white blood cells. It occurs through cytoplasmic streaming and pseudopodia formation.

Ciliary Movement – Movement facilitated by hair-like structures called cilia, as seen in the respiratory tract and paramecia.

Whorling Movement – A type of rotation movement, observed in some plant structures.

Muscular Movement – The movement that occurs due to muscle contraction, seen in most vertebrates and humans.

Location and Structure of Skeletal Muscles

Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and are responsible for voluntary movements. They work in coordination to produce movement and maintain posture.

Working of Skeletal Muscles

Muscles work by contracting and relaxing in response to nerve signals. Skeletal muscles often work in pairs, where one muscle contracts while the other relaxes.

Important Antagonistic Muscles

Flexor and Extensor – Flexors bend a limb, while extensors straighten it.

Abductor and Adductor – Abductors move a limb away from the body's midline, while adductors move it toward the midline.

Pronator and Supinator – Pronators turn the palm downward, while supinators turn it upward.

Levator and Depressor – Levators lift a structure, while depressors lower it.

Protractor and Retractor – Protractors push a structure forward, while retractors pull it backward.

Sphincters – Circular muscles that control the opening and closing of body passages.

Structure of Myosin and Actin Filaments

Muscle contraction is facilitated by two main protein filaments:

Myosin Filament – A thick filament responsible for muscle contraction.

Actin Filament – A thin filament that interacts with myosin to produce contraction. It consists of:

F actin – A filamentous form of actin.

Tropomyosin – A protein that blocks myosin-binding sites on actin.

Troponin – A regulatory protein that helps control contraction.

Mechanism of Muscle Contraction

Muscle contraction follows the sliding filament theory, where actin and myosin filaments slide past each other to shorten the muscle.

Steps of Muscle Contraction

Nerve impulse triggers calcium ion release.

Calcium binds to troponin, shifting tropomyosin and exposing binding sites.

Myosin heads attach to actin and pull it using ATP.

ATP hydrolysis resets the myosin head for another cycle.

Physiology of Muscle Relaxation

When stimulation stops, calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, tropomyosin re-covers the binding sites, and the muscle relaxes.

Skeletal System

The skeletal system provides support, movement, protection, and mineral storage.

Groups of Skeleton

Axial Skeleton – Includes the skull, vertebral column, and ribcage.

Appendicular Skeleton – Includes limbs and girdles (pectoral and pelvic).

Types of Joints

Joints are classified based on movement:

Synarthroses (Immovable Joints)

Sutures – Found in the skull, where bones are fused.

Syndesmoses – Ligamentous connections between bones.

Gomphoses – Peg-and-socket joints (e.g., teeth in jawbone).

Cartilaginous Joints (Slightly Movable Joints)

Synchondroses – Bones connected by hyaline cartilage (e.g., rib-sternum joint).

Symphysis – Bones connected by fibrocartilage (e.g., pubic symphysis).

Synovial Joints (Freely Movable Joints)

Pivot Joint – Allows rotation (e.g., neck).

Ball and Socket Joint – Allows multi-directional movement (e.g., shoulder and hip).

Hinge Joint – Allows movement in one plane (e.g., elbow and knee).

Condyloid Joint – Allows movement but not rotation (e.g., wrist).

Gliding Joint – Allows sliding motion (e.g., between carpals).

Saddle Joint – Allows movement in two directions (e.g., thumb base).

Disorders Related to Muscles

Muscular Dystrophy – A genetic disorder causing progressive muscle weakness.

Myasthenia Gravis – An autoimmune disorder that weakens voluntary muscles.

Disorders Related to Bones

Arthritis – Inflammation of joints.

Osteoarthritis – Degenerative joint disease due to cartilage breakdown.

,,,CHAPTER 4- STRUCTURE OF ATOM,"Structure of Atom

Subatomic Particles

Atoms are composed of three fundamental particles:

Electron: Discovered by J.J. Thomson, electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom.

Proton: Discovered by Ernest Rutherford, protons are positively charged particles located in the nucleus.

Neutron: Discovered by James Chadwick, neutrons are neutral particles present in the nucleus, contributing to the atomic mass.

Atomic Number and Atomic Mass Number

Atomic Number (Z): The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus, which determines the element’s identity.

Mass Number (A): The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom’s nucleus.

Isotopes: Atoms of the same element with different mass numbers due to varying neutron counts.

Isobars: Atoms of different elements with the same mass number but different atomic numbers.

Isotones: Atoms of different elements with the same number of neutrons but different atomic numbers and mass numbers.

Drawbacks of Rutherford’s Atomic Model

Rutherford’s model suggested that electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed orbits. However, this model could not explain:

The stability of the atom – classical physics predicted that electrons should spiral into the nucleus.

The atomic spectra – different elements produce distinct spectral lines, which Rutherford’s model could not account for.

Bohr’s Atomic Model

Niels Bohr introduced a refined model, incorporating quantum theory:

Electrons revolve in fixed energy levels (orbits) without radiating energy.

Energy is absorbed or emitted only when electrons jump between levels.

The energy of each level is given by:


This model successfully explained the hydrogen atom’s spectral lines.

Wave-Particle Duality of Electromagnetic Radiation

Light exhibits both particle-like and wave-like properties. This duality is crucial in quantum mechanics and is described by Planck’s quantum theory and Einstein’s photoelectric equation:


Line Emission Spectrum of Hydrogen

When hydrogen gas is excited, it emits specific wavelengths of light, forming a line spectrum. This phenomenon is explained using Bohr’s theory.

Quantum Mechanical Model of Atom

Erwin Schrödinger formulated a wave equation to describe electron behavior:


ψ (Wave function): Describes the probability of finding an electron.

ψ² (Probability density): Determines the likelihood of an electron’s location in space.

Radial Probability Distribution: Graphical representation of the probability of finding an electron at various distances from the nucleus.

Atomic Orbitals and Quantum Numbers

Each electron in an atom is described by four quantum numbers:

Principal Quantum Number (n): Defines the energy level.

Azimuthal Quantum Number (l): Defines the subshell (s, p, d, f).

Magnetic Quantum Number (mₗ): Defines the orientation of an orbital.

Spin Quantum Number (mₛ): Defines the electron spin (+½ or -½).

Electronic Configuration and Aufbau Principle

Electrons fill orbitals in increasing energy order, following:


Electronic Configurations of Chromium and Copper

These elements exhibit exceptions to the Aufbau principle:

Chromium (Cr): Expected: [Ar] 4s² 3d⁴ → Actual: [Ar] 4s¹ 3d⁵ (Half-filled stability)

Copper (Cu): Expected: [Ar] 4s² 3d⁹ → Actual: [Ar] 4s¹ 3d¹⁰ (Completely filled stability)

Introduction to Chemical Bonding
Chemical bonding is the force that holds atoms together in a molecule or compound. The study of chemical bonding explains how atoms interact and combine to form stable structures.

Chemical Bond
A chemical bond is an attractive force that binds atoms together in a molecule or crystal. It arises due to the tendency of atoms to attain a stable electronic configuration.

Causes of Chemical Combination
Tendency to acquire stability: Atoms combine to achieve a more stable state with lower energy.
Tendency to acquire noble gas configuration: Atoms tend to complete their outermost shell (usually with 8 electrons, like noble gases) to achieve stability.
Kossel-Lewis Approach to Chemical Bonding – Octet Rule
Kossel and Lewis Approach to Chemical Bonding
Gilbert N. Lewis and Walther Kossel proposed that atoms form bonds to achieve a noble gas configuration.
Lewis introduced the octet rule, which states that atoms tend to complete their octet (8 valence electrons) by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons.
Lewis Symbols
Lewis symbols represent the valence electrons of an atom as dots around its chemical symbol.
Example: Na (●) represents a sodium atom with 1 valence electron.
Significance of Lewis Symbols
They help predict the valency of an element.
They provide insight into how atoms interact during bond formation.
Lewis Symbols and Valence of Elements
The number of valence electrons determines the bonding capability of an element.
Example: Oxygen (O) has 6 valence electrons, so it can form 2 bonds.
Kossel-Lewis Approach to Chemical Bonding – Formal Charge
Formal Charge (F.C.)
Formal charge is the hypothetical charge on an atom in a molecule, assuming equal electron sharing. It is given by:

F.C.=(Valence electrons)−(Non-bonding electrons)− 
2

​
 
Assigning Formal Charge
Count valence electrons.
Count non-bonding electrons.
Count bonding electrons and divide by 2.
Apply the formal charge formula.
Kossel-Lewis Approach to Chemical Bonding – Limitations of the Octet Rule
Incomplete octet: Some elements (e.g., Be, B, Al) form stable compounds with fewer than 8 electrons.
Expanded octet: Elements in period 3 or beyond (e.g., P, S, Cl) can hold more than 8 electrons.
Odd-electron molecules: Some molecules (e.g., NO) have an odd number of valence electrons.
Shape and geometry: The octet rule does not explain molecular shapes accurately.
Other drawbacks: It cannot explain bonding in transition metals and molecules like BF₃.
Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory
Main Postulates of VSEPR Theory
Electron pairs repel each other, arranging themselves to minimize repulsion.
The number of bonding and lone pairs determines the molecular shape.
Geometry of Some Molecules
Linear: CO₂
Trigonal planar: BF₃
Tetrahedral: CH₄
Bent: H₂O
Steps to Predict Molecular Geometry
Determine the central atom.
Count valence electrons.
Identify bonding and lone pairs.
Apply VSEPR theory to predict geometry.
Valence Bond Theory (VBT)
Postulates of Valence Bond Theory
Covalent bonds form when atomic orbitals overlap.
Bond strength depends on the extent of orbital overlap.
Interacting Forces During Covalent Bond Formation
Force of repulsion: Occurs between like charges.
Force of attraction: Exists between the nucleus of one atom and the electrons of another.
Formation of Hydrogen Molecule (H₂) on the Basis of VBT
Two hydrogen atoms approach each other.
Their orbitals overlap, leading to bond formation.
Overlap of Atomic Orbitals
Sigma (σ) bonds: Head-on overlap of orbitals.
Pi (π) bonds: Sideways overlap of orbitals.
Limitations of VBT
Does not explain molecular shapes.
Fails to explain the energy levels of bonding electrons.
Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT)
Formation of Molecular Orbitals
Atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals.
Conditions for the Combination of Atomic Orbitals
Same energy level.
Same symmetry.
Significant overlap.
Types of Molecular Orbitals
Bonding molecular orbitals (BMO): Lower energy, stable.
Antibonding molecular orbitals (ABMO): Higher energy, unstable.
Energy Levels and Electronic Configuration
Molecular orbitals are arranged in increasing energy levels.

Key Ideas of MO Theory
Electrons fill molecular orbitals following Hund’s Rule and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
MO Description of Simple Diatomic Molecules
O₂: Has unpaired electrons, making it paramagnetic.
N₂: All electrons paired, making it diamagnetic.

,,,CHAPTER 6- REDOX RECTONS,"Chapter 6: Redox Reactions
Introduction to Redox Reactions
Redox reactions are chemical reactions in which oxidation (loss of electrons) and reduction (gain of electrons) occur simultaneously. These reactions are crucial in various chemical and biological processes, including metabolism, corrosion, and electrochemical cells.

Classical Ideas of Redox Reactions
Historically, oxidation and reduction were defined based on oxygen transfer:

Oxidation: Addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen.
Reduction: Removal of oxygen or addition of hydrogen.

Oxidation Number
The oxidation number (or oxidation state) is a value assigned to an element in a compound that represents its degree of oxidation or reduction. It helps in balancing redox reactions and identifying the electron transfer process.

Rules to Assign Oxidation Number
The oxidation number of a free element is always zero. (e.g., O₂, N₂)
The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge. (e.g., Na⁺ = +1, Cl⁻ = -1)
Oxygen in compounds usually has an oxidation number of -2, except in peroxides (-1) and superoxides (-½).
Hydrogen is +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals.
The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero.
The sum of oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion equals the charge of the ion.
Stock Notation
Stock notation is used to indicate the oxidation state of elements with variable oxidation numbers using Roman numerals.
Example:

FeCl₂ → Iron(II) chloride
FeCl₃ → Iron(III) chloride
Redox Reactions in Terms of Oxidation Number
A redox reaction can be analyzed by tracking changes in oxidation numbers.

If the oxidation number increases, the element is oxidized.
If the oxidation number decreases, the element is reduced.

Redox Reaction and Electrode Potential
Electrode potential is a measure of the tendency of an electrode to gain or lose electrons. It helps in predicting redox reactions in electrochemical cells.

Standard Electrode Potential (E°)
The potential of an electrode compared to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
More positive E° means stronger oxidizing agent (e.g., Cu²⁺/Cu = +0.34V).

,,,CHAPTER 7- MODERN PERIODIC TABLE,"Chapter 7: Modern Periodic Table - Explanation
1. What is the Periodic Table?
Imagine you have a huge collection of chemical elements (like hydrogen, oxygen, iron, gold, etc.), and you want to organize them in a meaningful way. The periodic table does this by arranging elements based on their atomic number (number of protons) and chemical properties.

Why is it useful?
It helps us predict properties of elements even if we haven't tested them.
It shows trends in properties (like atomic size, reactivity, etc.).
It groups elements that behave similarly, making chemistry easier to study.
2. Evolution of the Periodic Table
The periodic table didn't always look like this! Here’s how it evolved:

Döbereiner’s Triads (1817): Some elements grouped in sets of three (triads) had a pattern in their atomic masses and properties. But this didn’t work for all elements.
Newlands’ Law of Octaves (1865): He noticed that every eighth element had similar properties (like musical notes repeating in octaves). But this rule didn’t fit heavier elements.
Mendeleev’s Periodic Table (1869): Arranged elements by atomic mass, left gaps for undiscovered elements, and even predicted their properties. It was great, but some elements didn’t fit in order.
Modern Periodic Table (1913, Henry Moseley): Based on atomic number (protons) instead of atomic mass, which fixed the issues in Mendeleev’s table.
3. Structure of the Modern Periodic Table
How is it arranged?
The periodic table has rows and columns:

Periods (Horizontal Rows) → Show an increasing number of electron shells.
Groups (Vertical Columns) → Elements in a group have the same number of valence electrons, so they behave similarly.
How Many?
7 Periods (Row numbers)
18 Groups (Column numbers)
4. The Connection Between Periodic Table & Electronic Configuration
Think of electrons as students sitting in classrooms (shells).

Each row (period) adds a new classroom (electron shell).
Each group (column) has the same number of students in the last classroom (valence electrons).
Example:

Sodium (Na) → 2,8,1 (Group 1, Period 3)
Chlorine (Cl) → 2,8,7 (Group 17, Period 3)
Even though sodium and chlorine are in the same period (same number of shells), they behave differently because their valence electrons are different.

5. The Four Blocks of the Periodic Table
Elements are divided into four blocks based on their electron configuration:

(1) s-Block Elements (Groups 1 & 2)
These elements have their outermost electrons in the ‘s’ orbital.
Highly reactive metals, like sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca).
(2) p-Block Elements (Groups 13-18)
Their outermost electrons are in the ‘p’ orbital.
Includes metals, metalloids, and nonmetals.
Contains halogens (Group 17) and noble gases (Group 18).
(3) d-Block Elements (Transition Metals, Groups 3-12)
These are hard, shiny metals like iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and gold (Au).
Used in construction, electrical wiring, and jewelry.
Have variable oxidation states (can lose different numbers of electrons).
(4) f-Block Elements (Lanthanides & Actinides)
Rare earth metals & radioactive elements.
Used in nuclear energy and magnets.
6. Periodic Trends (How Properties Change in the Table)
1. Effective Nuclear Charge (Zeff) & Screening Effect
What is it? The force an electron feels from the nucleus after other electrons ""block"" some of the attraction.
Trend:
Increases across a period (electrons pulled closer to nucleus).
Decreases down a group (more shells → weaker attraction).
2. Physical Properties Trends
a) Atomic Radius (Size of an Atom)
Across a Period → Decreases (more protons pull electrons closer).
Down a Group → Increases (more shells, making the atom bigger).
Example: Li (Lithium) is bigger than F (Fluorine).
b) Ionic Radius (Size of an Ion)
Cations (positive ions) → Smaller than neutral atoms (fewer electrons).
Anions (negative ions) → Larger (extra electrons repel each other).
c) Ionization Enthalpy (Energy to Remove an Electron)
Across a Period → Increases (harder to remove electrons).
Down a Group → Decreases (easier to remove electrons).
Example: It’s harder to remove an electron from Fluorine than from Sodium.
d) Electron Gain Enthalpy (Energy Change When an Electron is Added)
Across a Period → More negative (atoms want extra electrons).
Down a Group → Less negative (atoms don’t want extra electrons as much).
e) Electronegativity (Ability to Attract Electrons in a Bond)
Across a Period → Increases (nonmetals want electrons more).
Down a Group → Decreases (atoms don’t pull electrons as strongly).
Example: Fluorine is the most electronegative element!
3. Chemical Properties Trends
a) Valency (How Many Electrons an Atom Can Gain/Lose/Share)
Across a Period: Increases from 1 to 4, then decreases from 4 to 0.
Down a Group: Stays the same.
b) Metallic & Non-Metallic Character
Across a Period: Metals → Nonmetals
Down a Group: More metallic.
Example: Sodium (Na) is a metal, but Chlorine (Cl) is a nonmetal.
c) Chemical Reactivity
Metals: More reactive down a group (easier to lose electrons).
Nonmetals: More reactive across a period (stronger pull for electrons).
Example:

Potassium (K) is more reactive than Sodium (Na) (because it’s lower in Group 1).
Fluorine (F) is more reactive than Oxygen (O) (because it’s further right in Group 17).",5,1800,"Periodic Table

Introduction

Matter exists in different states: solid, liquid, and gas. These states depend on the intermolecular forces and the kinetic energy of particles. This chapter focuses on the gaseous and liquid states of matter, explaining their properties, laws governing them, and deviations from ideal behavior.

Intermolecular Forces

Intermolecular forces are attractive forces between molecules that determine the physical properties of substances. The different types include:

Types of Intermolecular Forces

Dipole-Dipole Interactions: Forces between polar molecules where the positive end of one molecule attracts the negative end of another.

Ion-Dipole Interactions: Occur between an ion and a polar molecule.

Dipole-Induced Dipole Interactions: Arise when a polar molecule induces a temporary dipole in a non-polar molecule.

London Dispersion Forces: Weak attractions due to temporary dipoles in non-polar molecules.

Hydrogen Bonding: A strong dipole-dipole force occurring when hydrogen is bonded to highly electronegative elements (O, N, or F).

Intermolecular Forces and Thermal Energy

Intermolecular forces hold molecules together, but thermal energy tends to keep them apart.

The balance between these determines the state of matter.

Characteristic Properties of Gases

2. Basics of Food Chemistry
Food chemistry deals with the chemical processes and interactions of biological and non-biological components in food.

2.1 Food Quality Chemistry
Food undergoes various chemical changes that affect its quality, taste, and shelf life.

(i) Browning of Cut Fruits and Vegetables
Enzymatic Browning: When fruits or vegetables are cut, the enzyme polyphenol oxidase reacts with oxygen to form brown pigments called melanins.
Prevention: Lemon juice (containing citric acid) slows down browning by lowering pH and acting as an antioxidant.
(ii) Rancidity of Oils and Fats
Rancidity: The oxidation of oils and fats leads to an unpleasant taste and odor.
Types of Rancidity:
Oxidative rancidity: Reaction of fats with oxygen.
Hydrolytic rancidity: Breakdown of fats by moisture or enzymes.
Prevention: Adding antioxidants like BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene), refrigeration, and vacuum sealing.
(iii) Saturated, Unsaturated, and Trans Fats
Saturated Fats: No double bonds (e.g., butter, lard, coconut oil).
Unsaturated Fats: Contain one or more double bonds (e.g., olive oil, sunflower oil).
Trans Fats: Formed by partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils, leading to health risks like heart disease.
(iv) Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Essential fatty acids found in fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds.
Important for brain function and heart health.
(v) Antioxidants as Food Additives
Prevent oxidation and spoilage of food.
Examples: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), Vitamin E (tocopherol), BHA, and BHT.
3. Compounds with Medicinal Properties

,,,CHAPTER 2.4- UPON WESTMINISTER BRIDGE,"Introduction:
""Composed Upon Westminster Bridge"" is a Petrarchan sonnet written by William Wordsworth on September 3, 1802. The poem captures a rare, serene moment in London as seen from Westminster Bridge during the early hours of the morning. Wordsworth, a leading poet of the Romantic era, was known for his deep appreciation of nature and the sublime, but in this poem, he expresses admiration for the beauty of a human-made city.

Rather than portraying London as a busy, polluted, and noisy city, he describes it as calm, majestic, and breathtakingly beautiful under the golden morning light. The poem contrasts the usual hustle and bustle of urban life with the rare tranquility of dawn, revealing Wordsworth's ability to find beauty even in a cityscape.

Detailed Summary:
Opening Lines (Lines 1–4):
Earth has not anything to show more fair:
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty:
This City now doth, like a garment, wear

The poem begins with a bold claim: Wordsworth states that there is nothing more beautiful on Earth than what he is witnessing at this moment. He insists that anyone who fails to recognize this beauty must be dull and lacking in appreciation. The phrase ""touching in its majesty"" conveys both an emotional and a grand, noble quality to the city.

In the fourth line, he compares London to a garment, suggesting that the morning light is like a beautiful piece of clothing draped over the city. This metaphor creates an image of the city being adorned in natural beauty, something unexpected for a place usually associated with industrialization.

Middle Section (Lines 5–8):
The beauty of the morning: silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.

Here, Wordsworth describes the cityscape in the soft morning light, emphasizing its silence and openness. Unlike the usual smoggy, polluted air of industrial London, the morning is clear and “smokeless”, allowing the sun to highlight the architectural beauty of ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples.

This part of the poem celebrates a rare harmony between the city and nature, where the urban structures seem to blend seamlessly with the fields and sky. Wordsworth paints London not as a center of commerce and industry but as a serene and almost magical place.

Final Lines (Lines 9–14):
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at his own sweet will:
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
And all that mighty heart is lying still!

In these concluding lines, Wordsworth makes another strong assertion—he claims that even the natural landscapes of valleys, rocks, and hills have never looked as beautiful as London does at this moment. This is a striking statement from a poet known for glorifying nature, as he now expresses equal admiration for an urban scene.

The line ""Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!"" emphasizes the profound stillness of the city at dawn. The River Thames is personified, flowing at its ""own sweet will"", suggesting a peaceful and natural rhythm.

Finally, he exclaims, ""Dear God! the very houses seem asleep"", reinforcing the sense of calm and quiet. The phrase “mighty heart is lying still” refers to London as the beating heart of the country, which, for this brief moment, is at rest before the chaos of the day begins.

Themes:
1. Urban Beauty & Romanticism
The poem challenges the typical Romantic focus on rural nature by showing that even a city can be beautiful when viewed from the right perspective.
The stillness of London in the morning contrasts with its usual chaotic energy, making it a unique moment of peace and harmony.
2. Stillness vs. Movement
The city, which is usually full of movement and noise, appears frozen in time under the morning light.
The River Thames is the only thing in motion, emphasizing nature’s continuous and effortless beauty.
3. Nature & Light
The sunlight transforms London into something almost divine, proving that nature’s beauty can extend to man-made environments.
The smokeless air symbolizes purity and allows the poet to see the city in its natural glory.
4. Awe & Admiration
Wordsworth’s use of exclamation marks, grand statements, and religious references (“Dear God!”) expresses his overwhelming admiration.

,,,CHAPTER 2.5- NOSE VERSUS EYES,"Introduction:
""Nose Versus Eyes"" is a humorous satirical poem written by William Cowper, an 18th-century English poet. The poem is a mock trial where the Nose and Eyes are in a legal dispute over which sense organ has the right to own and use spectacles (glasses).

The Eyes claim that since spectacles are meant for seeing, they naturally belong to them. However, the Nose argues that spectacles rest on it and therefore should be considered its property. A judge (a tongue) presides over the case, and in a twist of irony, he rules that the Nose should be the rightful owner of the spectacles.

Through this witty legal satire, Cowper criticizes absurd legal decisions and the flaws in human reasoning. He uses personification, irony, and humor to make a deeper commentary on how laws can sometimes favor illogical conclusions.

Detailed Summary:
Opening Lines (Lines 1–4):
Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose,
The spectacles set them unhappily wrong;
The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,
To which the said spectacles ought to belong.

The poem begins by introducing a legal conflict between the Nose and the Eyes over who has the right to spectacles. The disagreement is serious, even though it seems absurd. The phrase “as all the world knows” is ironic because this is obviously not a real-world issue—it highlights the ridiculousness of the case.

Middle Section (Lines 5–8):
So the Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause
With a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning;
While Chief Baron Ear sat to balance the laws,
So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.

The Tongue acts as the lawyer, using its ability to speak and argue to present the case.
The Ear serves as the judge, reinforcing the personification of body parts.
The phrase “wig full of learning” mocks lawyers who use fancy words and legal jargon, implying that knowledge alone doesn’t always lead to just decisions.
The Arguments (Lines 9–12):
In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,
And your lordship, he said, will undoubtedly find,
That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,
Which amounts to possession time out of mind.

The Nose’s argument is simple: since spectacles rest on the nose, it should own them.
The phrase “possession time out of mind” is a reference to legal doctrine—if someone has owned something for a long time, they may claim ownership by law.
This mimics real-world legal disputes, where possession sometimes outweighs logic.
The Judgment (Lines 13–16):
Then, holding the spectacles up to the court—
Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle
As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,
Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.

The judge (the Ear) inspects the spectacles and notices that they are shaped to fit the nose, just like a saddle fits a horse.
This comparison makes the argument sound reasonable, even though it is clearly flawed—spectacles are for vision, not for resting on the nose.
Final Verdict (Lines 17–20):
Again, would your lordship a moment suppose
('Tis a case that has happened, and may be again)
That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,
Pray who would, or who could, wear spectacles then?

The judge argues that if a person had no nose, spectacles could not stay on their face.
He completely ignores the purpose of spectacles (helping vision) and focuses only on their placement.
This is an example of flawed legal reasoning—it follows technicalities rather than common sense.
Closing Lines (Lines 21–24):
The court was tired with the length of the case,
And thus with a learned, decisive air,
Declared in a voice both steady and base,
That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on, they should sit there.

The case is long and tiring, reflecting how real-life court cases often drag on unnecessarily.
The judge delivers the final verdict, ruling that spectacles belong to the Nose simply because that is where they rest.
The absurdity of the decision mirrors how legal rulings can sometimes defy logic and justice.
Themes:
1. Satire on Legal System
The poem mocks legal proceedings by showing how laws and judgments can lead to absurd decisions.
It highlights how technicalities often take precedence over common sense.
2. Flawed Logic & Absurdity
The judge’s reasoning is based on possession, not purpose—a clear logical fallacy.
This mirrors real-world situations where judicial decisions can seem unreasonable.
3. Personification & Humor
The Nose, Eyes, Tongue, and Ear are given human roles in a court case, making the poem entertaining and engaging.
The exaggerated seriousness of the trial makes the situation funny and ironic.
4. Commentary on Authority & Power
The judge’s final ruling is unquestioned, even though it makes no sense.
This reflects how people in power (like judges or lawmakers) can sometimes make illogical decisions, yet they are accepted simply because of their authority.",818,7,"William Cowper

,,,CHAPTER 2.6- THE PLANNERS,"The Planners"" – Detailed Explanation
Introduction:
""The Planners"" is a poem by Boey Kim Cheng, a Singaporean poet known for his critical perspectives on urban development and modernization. This poem expresses the poet’s frustration with rapid urbanization and the loss of cultural identity.

Boey criticizes how city planners erase history and nature in favor of perfectly structured, artificial cities. The poem explores themes of destruction, uniformity, modernization, loss of heritage, and emotional detachment. Using imagery, irony, and repetition, Boey highlights the soulless perfection of modern cities, where everything is measured and controlled, leaving no room for individuality or memories.

Detailed Summary:
Opening Lines (Lines 1–4):
They plan. They build. All spaces are gridded,
filled with permutations of possibilities.
The buildings are in alignment with the roads
which meet at desired points linked by bridges.

The poem begins abruptly with short, firm sentences: ""They plan. They build.""
""They"" refers to the planners, the engineers and architects who design the city.
""Gridded"" spaces suggest rigid control and uniformity, with no room for natural beauty or randomness.
""Permutations of possibilities"" implies that every aspect of the city is pre-calculated and artificial, removing any organic growth.
""Buildings are in alignment"" emphasizes precision and perfection, but also suggests a lack of uniqueness or creativity.
Middle Section (Lines 5–13):
They have it all so it will not hurt,
they build and will not stop.
Even the sea draws back
and the skies surrender.

The planners are relentless; they build without stopping, without considering the emotional or environmental impact.
The phrase ""so it will not hurt"" suggests that the planners aim for a flawless, painless city, but in doing so, they remove all traces of history and culture.
The sea and sky ""surrender"", symbolizing nature being overpowered by human construction.
The poet suggests that even natural forces cannot resist urbanization, showing the overwhelming power of modernization.
The Impact of Modernization (Lines 14–21):
They erase the flaws,
the blemishes of the past, knock off
useless blocks with dental dexterity.
All gaps are plugged
with gleaming gold.

The planners remove ""flaws"" and ""blemishes"", which represent history, culture, and imperfections that make a place unique.
The phrase ""knock off useless blocks with dental dexterity"" compares city planning to dentistry, where imperfections are removed to create a perfect smile.
""All gaps are plugged with gleaming gold"" suggests that money and materialism have replaced authenticity and history.
The Loss of Memory (Lines 22–29):
The country wears perfect rows
of shining teeth.
Anesthesia, amnesia, hypnosis.
They have the means.
They have it all so it will not hurt,
so history is new again.

The poet extends the dentistry metaphor, saying that the city has ""perfect rows of shining teeth"", symbolizing artificial perfection.
""Anesthesia, amnesia, hypnosis"" suggests that the planners numb people's emotions, erase their memories, and control their perceptions, making them accept modernization blindly.
The phrase ""history is new again"" is ironic, meaning that history is rewritten or erased to fit the perfect, modern city.
The Poet’s Frustration (Final Lines, 30–34):
The drilling goes right through
the fossils of last century.
But my heart would not bleed
poetry. Not a single drop
to stain the blueprint of our past.

The drilling through fossils represents the destruction of history and culture to make way for modern buildings.
The poet feels emotionally detached, saying ""my heart would not bleed poetry.""
He expresses hopelessness because even poetry—often used to resist injustice—cannot stop the relentless progress of urbanization.
""Not a single drop to stain the blueprint"" shows that the past is being erased so completely that nothing remains to mark its existence.
Themes:
1. The Destruction of History
The planners erase historical landmarks to create a modern, uniform city.
The phrase ""fossils of last century"" symbolizes the disappearance of cultural heritage.
2. The Artificiality of Modernization
The city is designed to be perfect, but this perfection feels soulless and mechanical.
The metaphor of dentistry (fixing ""flaws"" and making things ""gleam"") shows how modernization removes uniqueness.
3. Emotional and Cultural Loss
The poet feels detached and helpless in the face of urbanization.
The words ""anesthesia, amnesia, hypnosis"" show that people are numbed, made to forget, and controlled.
4. The Power of Authority
The planners have total control over the city’s development.
Their ""blueprint"" is final—no one can challenge or change it.",713,7,"Boey Kim Cheng

,,,CHAPTER 4.1 - HISTORY OF ENGLISH DRAMA,"Explanation
The history of English drama is a rich and varied narrative that spans centuries, evolving from early religious plays to the complex and diverse genres we have today. English drama has been influenced by numerous historical, cultural, and social changes, reflecting the concerns and aspirations of different periods. The study of English drama not only focuses on the development of theatrical forms but also highlights the significant playwrights and the social functions of drama in various historical contexts.

Early English Drama
English drama has its roots in the medieval period, where religious plays known as mystery and morality plays were performed. These plays were often performed in churches and depicted biblical stories or moral lessons.

Mystery Plays: These were biblical stories, often enacted by trade guilds, that depicted the creation, the fall of man, the life of Christ, and the Last Judgment.
Morality Plays: These plays focused on moral allegories, featuring characters personifying virtues and vices. The most famous example is Everyman, where the protagonist faces the inevitability of death and the question of salvation.
The Elizabethan Era
The Elizabethan era, under Queen Elizabeth I’s reign, is often considered the golden age of English drama. It saw the rise of public theatres and the creation of some of the most enduring works in the history of drama, notably those by William Shakespeare. This period marked the shift from religious to secular drama, and playwrights explored complex themes of politics, love, identity, and fate.

William Shakespeare: Often regarded as the greatest playwright in the English language, Shakespeare's plays, such as Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and Macbeth, combined tragedy, comedy, history, and romance, revolutionizing English drama.
Christopher Marlowe: A contemporary of Shakespeare, Marlowe’s plays, including Doctor Faustus, were characterized by their exploration of human ambition and the consequences of defying moral boundaries.
Ben Jonson: Known for his satirical comedies and character-driven plots, Jonson’s works like Volpone and The Alchemist had a profound influence on later playwrights.
The Jacobean and Caroline Era
The Jacobean era, named after King James I, continued the developments of Elizabethan drama but with a darker and more cynical tone. This period saw a rise in tragedies, often dealing with themes of corruption, power, and revenge.

John Webster: Known for his intense tragedies The Duchess of Malfi and The White Devil, which are characterized by their psychological depth and exploration of the darker aspects of human nature.
Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher: They co-wrote many plays, including Philaster and The Maid's Tragedy, which focused on complex human emotions and political intrigue.
The Caroline era, under King Charles I, continued this trend of exploring complex themes, but also saw the rise of courtly masques, lavish spectacles performed at the royal court.

The Restoration Period
The Restoration period, following the English Civil War and the return of Charles II in 1660, saw the reopening of theatres that had been closed during the war. This period is marked by the emergence of Restoration comedy, a genre known for its witty, often risqué humor, and its satirical take on social norms.

William Congreve: His plays, like The Way of the World and Love for Love, explored the complexities of love and marriage with biting wit and sophisticated characterizations.
George Etherege: Known for his comedy The Man of Mode, Etherege helped set the tone for Restoration comedy, with an emphasis on sexual politics and social satire.
The 18th and 19th Centuries
The 18th century saw the development of sentimental comedy, which aimed to uplift audiences with moral lessons. However, the 19th century brought a major shift with the rise of melodrama, focusing on exaggerated emotions and clear moral opposites.

Richard Sheridan: His comedies, like The School for Scandal, were sharp critiques of high society, combining humor with sharp social commentary.
Oscar Wilde: In the late 19th century, Wilde's works, such as The Importance of Being Earnest, represented a high point of British comedy, blending satire with clever dialogue.
The Modern Era
In the 20th century, English drama diversified further, with the advent of realism and absurdism, as playwrights began to explore human psychology, societal issues, and existential themes. Playwrights like George Bernard Shaw, T.S. Eliot, and Harold Pinter were central figures in this era.

George Bernard Shaw: Known for his sharp social criticism, Shaw’s plays like Pygmalion addressed class, education, and gender issues.
Harold Pinter: His plays, such as The Birthday Party and The Homecoming, are known for their use of language, pauses, and the exploration of power dynamics.",746,7,"English Drama

It is famous for its intricate plot that interweaves multiple storylines involving Athenian lovers, a group of amateur actors, and a group of fairies led by the mischievous Puck.

Plot Summary:
The play begins with a conflict between two Athenian lovers, Hermia and Lysander, who are in love but are not allowed to marry because Hermia's father, Egeus, wants her to marry Demetrius. However, Hermia and Lysander plan to flee to the forest to get married. Meanwhile, Demetrius, who loves Hermia, follows them into the forest, with Helena, who is desperately in love with Demetrius, following him. In the forest, the fairy king Oberon and his servant Puck meddle with the lovers’ affections, causing confusion and chaos. After much confusion and magical interference, the lovers’ relationships are restored, and they are married. The play ends with a performance of the play within the play by a group of amateur actors, culminating in a happy, comedic resolution.

Key Themes and Concepts:

Love and its complications: The central theme of the play, exploring how love can be unpredictable, irrational, and chaotic.
Magic and transformation: The intervention of magic in the form of the love potion causes confusion and chaos, as well as transformation in the relationships.
Dreams and reality: The play often blurs the lines between reality and dreams, highlighting the ephemeral and elusive nature of love and desire.
An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen
An Enemy of the People is a play written by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in 1882. The play focuses on the themes of truth, integrity, and the social and moral responsibility of individuals. The protagonist, Dr. Thomas Stockmann, discovers that the water in his town's public baths, which are a source of the town’s economy, is contaminated and dangerous. When he attempts to expose the truth, he faces opposition from his family, the local authorities, and the townspeople who are more concerned with their own economic well-being than the health of the community.

Plot Summary:
Dr. Stockmann’s discovery of the contaminated water puts him at odds with the local government and powerful businessmen who rely on the success of the baths for their livelihood. Despite his efforts to warn the people and call for action, Stockmann is labeled an enemy of the people for disrupting the social order and challenging the town's economic interests. His brother, Peter, who is the town's mayor, tries to suppress the truth to avoid economic disaster. Dr. Stockmann becomes increasingly isolated and alienated, standing by his moral conviction that truth must come before convenience. The play ends with Dr. Stockmann's defiance of the majority and his belief in the individual's responsibility to seek the truth, no matter the consequences.

Key Themes and Concepts:

The individual versus society: The play examines the tension between personal integrity and the pressure to conform to societal expectations.
The corruption of power: It critiques the ways in which power structures prioritize economic stability and the status quo over the well-being of individuals and truth.
The role of the media: The play explores how the press and public opinion can be manipulated by those in power to control the narrative and silence dissent.",593,6,"A Midsummer Night's Dream

,,PHYSICS,CHAPTER 1- UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS,"1. Introduction of Units and Measurements
Units and measurements are the foundation of science and are used to express physical quantities in a standardized manner. They allow us to communicate scientific ideas, compare measurements, and perform calculations with consistency. This chapter introduces the concept of measuring physical quantities and the systems used to represent them.

2. System of Units
A system of units refers to a standardized set of units used to measure physical quantities. The most commonly used system today is the International System of Units (SI). There are two main categories of units in any system:

Fundamental Quantities: Basic quantities that cannot be expressed in terms of other quantities.
Derived Quantities: Quantities that are formed by combining fundamental quantities.
3. Fundamental Quantities and Units
Fundamental quantities are basic physical quantities that do not depend on other physical quantities for their definition. The seven fundamental quantities in the SI system are:

Length (L) - The distance between two points.
Mass (M) - The amount of matter in an object.
Time (T) - The progression of events.
Electric Current (I) - The flow of electric charge.
Temperature (θ) - A measure of the thermal energy of a system.
Amount of Substance (n) - The number of particles (atoms, molecules) in a sample.
Luminous Intensity (Iv) - The perceived power of light.
The corresponding SI units are:

Meter (m) for Length
Kilogram (kg) for Mass
Second (s) for Time
Ampere (A) for Electric Current
Kelvin (K) for Temperature
Mole (mol) for Amount of Substance
Candela (cd) for Luminous Intensity
4. Derived Quantities and Units
Derived quantities are formed from the combination of fundamental quantities. Examples include:

Area (L²) – Square meter (m²)
Volume (L³) – Cubic meter (m³)
Velocity (L/T) – Meter per second (m/s)
Force (M·L/T²) – Newton (N)
Work/Energy (M·L²/T²) – Joule (J)
5. Conventions for the Use of SI Units
The SI system is internationally recognized and allows scientists and engineers to express measurements in a standardized way. The SI units should always be used in scientific work to maintain consistency and avoid confusion.

Prefixes like kilo (k), mega (M), centi (c), and milli (m) are used to express very large or small quantities. For example:

1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters
1 millisecond (ms) = 0.001 seconds
6. Measurement of Length
Length is one of the most commonly measured physical quantities. The basic unit of length is the meter (m), but different units are used depending on the scale of the measurement:

Subunit of meter: millimeter (mm), centimeter (cm), micrometer (µm)
Multiple units of meter: kilometer (km)
Measuring Large Distances
Parallax Method: The parallax method is used for measuring large distances, such as the distance between celestial objects. It involves measuring the angle between the object and a fixed reference point from two different locations.
Measuring Small Distances (Size of Molecules)
Electron Microscopy: For very small distances like the size of molecules, electron microscopes or atomic force microscopes are used to measure on the atomic scale.
7. Measurement of Mass
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. It is typically measured using a balance. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).

Range of Mass:

Very small masses are measured in milligrams (mg) or grams (g).
Very large masses are measured in metric tons (t).
8. Measurement of Time
Time is measured using clocks and watches. The SI unit of time is the second (s). Very accurate time measurements are made using atomic clocks.

9. Dimensions and Dimensional Analysis
Dimensions of a quantity express its physical nature. For example:

Length: [L]
Mass: [M]
Time: [T]
Dimensional Analysis is a method to express physical quantities in terms of their fundamental dimensions. It helps in deriving formulas, converting units, and checking the consistency of equations.

Uses of Dimensional Analysis:
To check the correctness of physical equations.
To derive new equations.
To convert one unit to another.
Limitations of Dimensional Analysis:
It cannot provide exact values for constants.
It cannot help in deriving equations for quantities that are not dimensionally similar.
10. Accuracy, Precision, and Uncertainty in Measurement
Accuracy refers to how close a measured value is to the true value. Precision refers to the consistency of measurements when repeated.

Uncertainty is an estimate of the doubt in a measurement. It can be due to limitations in instruments or methods.

11. Errors in Measurements
Errors are deviations from the true value. There are two types of errors:

Systematic errors: These errors are consistent and predictable. They arise from imperfections in the measurement system.

Instrumental errors
Errors due to experimental techniques
Procedural errors
Personal errors
Random errors: These errors vary unpredictably. They are caused by uncontrollable factors such as environmental fluctuations.

Least Count Error: The smallest measurement that an instrument can measure.

Absolute Error: The difference between the measured value and the true value.

Mean Absolute Error: The average of the absolute errors from multiple measurements.

Relative Error or Fractional Error: The ratio of the absolute error to the measured value.

Percentage Error: The relative error expressed as a percentage.

Combination of Percentage Errors:

Error of a sum or difference: The errors are added.
Error of a product or quotient: The errors are added in relative terms.
Error of a measured quantity raised to a power: The error is multiplied by the exponent.
12. Significant Figures
Significant figures are the digits in a number that carry meaningful information about its precision.

Rules for significant figures:
All non-zero digits are significant.
Zeros between non-zero digits are significant.
Leading zeros are not significant.
Trailing zeros in a decimal number are significant.
Arithmetic with Significant Figures:
Addition and Subtraction: The result should be rounded to the least number of decimal places.
Multiplication and Division: The result should have the same number of significant figures as the number with the least significant figures.
Rounding-off in Measurement:
Rounding is done when a measurement has more digits than required. It follows specific rules to ensure that the rounded-off value reflects the correct level of precision.",1004,3,"Units

,,,CHAPTER 2 MATHEMATICAL METHODS,"Chapter 2: Mathematical Methods - Vector Analysis
1. Scalars:

Scalars are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude (numerical value) and have no direction. Examples of scalar quantities include mass, temperature, time, distance, and speed.

2. Vectors:

Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They are represented by arrows, where the length of the arrow indicates the magnitude and the direction of the arrow shows the direction of the vector. Examples include displacement, velocity, force, and acceleration.

Vector Operations:
1. Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar:

When a vector is multiplied by a scalar (a real number), its magnitude changes by the scalar value, but its direction remains the same (unless the scalar is negative, in which case the direction is reversed). This operation is called scalar multiplication.

Mathematically, if vector A is multiplied by a scalar k, the resulting vector kA is given by:

𝑘
×
𝐴
⃗
=
(
𝑘
𝐴
𝑥
,

,
𝑘
𝐴

)
k× 
A
 =(kA 
x
​
 ,kA 
y
​
 ,kA 
z
​
 )
Where A_x, A_y, and A_z are the components of vector A in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

2. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors:

Vectors are added and subtracted based on the component method. To add or subtract vectors, the corresponding components of the vectors are added or subtracted.

If A and B are vectors, then:

𝐶
⃗

Graphically, vector addition can be done using the triangle law and the parallelogram law.

3. Triangle Law for Vector Addition:

The triangle law states that if two vectors A and B are represented by two sides of a triangle in a particular order, then the vector sum A + B is represented by the third side of the triangle, drawn in the opposite direction.

4. Law of Parallelogram of Vectors:

According to this law, if two vectors are represented by two adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of the parallelogram gives the resultant vector. This method is geometrically used to find the sum of two vectors.

Resolution of Vectors:
Resolution of a Vector:

Resolution of a vector involves breaking it down into two or more components, typically along the x and y axes. This is particularly useful when dealing with forces or velocities in two-dimensional space. If a vector A makes an angle θ with the x-axis, it can be resolved into:

A_x = A cos(θ) (component along the x-axis)
A_y = A sin(θ) (component along the y-axis)
These components can be used to analyze the vector's effect in each direction.

Unit Vector:

A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1. It is used to represent the direction of a vector. The unit vector in the direction of vector A is given by:

𝐴
^
=
𝐴
⃗
∣
𝐴
⃗
∣
A
^
 = 
∣ 
A
 ∣
A
 
​
 
Where |
𝐴
⃗
A
 | is the magnitude of vector A. The unit vector is typically denoted by a ""hat"" symbol (e.g., 
𝑖
^
i
^
 , 
𝑗
^
j
^
​
 , 
𝑘
^
k
^
 ).

Multiplication of Vectors:
1. Scalar Product (Dot Product):

The dot product of two vectors A and B is a scalar quantity and is defined as:

𝐴
⃗
⋅
𝐵
⃗
=
∣
𝐴
⃗
∣
∣
𝐵
⃗
∣
cos
⁡
(

A

A

B
 ∣cos(θ)
Where θ is the angle between vectors A and B, and |
𝐴
⃗
A
 | and |
𝐵
⃗
B
 | are the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product is commutative, meaning A·B = B·A. The dot product can also be written in terms of the components of the vectors:

𝐴
⃗
⋅
𝐵
⃗
=
𝐴

This operation gives the projection of one vector along the other and is useful for determining angles between vectors or for finding the work done by a force.

2. Vector Product (Cross Product):

The cross product of two vectors A and B results in a vector that is perpendicular to both A and B. The magnitude of the cross product is given by:

∣
𝐴
⃗
×
𝐵
⃗
∣
=

 ∣=∣ 
A
 ∣∣

 ∣sin(θ)
The direction of the resultant vector is determined by the right-hand rule. In component form, the cross product is:

The cross product is used in physics to find quantities such as torque and angular momentum.

Characteristics of Vector Product:
Non-commutative: The cross product is not commutative, meaning A × B ≠ B × A. In fact, A × B = - (B × A).
Distributive: The cross product is distributive over vector addition, i.e., A × (B + C) = A × B + A × C.
Magnitude: The magnitude of the cross product gives the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. It is maximized when the vectors are perpendicular to each other.
Introduction to Calculus:
1. Differential Calculus:

Differential calculus focuses on the concept of the derivative, which describes the rate of change of a function. It deals with finding how a function changes as its input changes. For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) is defined as the limit:

The derivative gives the slope of the tangent line to the function at a given point and is crucial in understanding motion, growth, and many physical processes.

2. Integral Calculus:

Integral calculus is concerned with finding the total accumulation of quantities, such as area under a curve. The integral of a function f(x) over an interval [a, b] is defined as:

,,,CHAPTER 3- MOTION IN A PLANE,"Chapter 3: Motion in a Plane
1. Introduction to Motion in a Plane
Motion in a plane refers to the motion of an object in two dimensions. An object is said to be moving in a plane when its position changes in both the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) directions. This can occur in a variety of ways, including straight-line motion (rectilinear motion) and curved paths (such as circular or projectile motion).

In this chapter, we focus on various aspects of motion in two dimensions, examining how displacement, velocity, and acceleration behave when an object moves through a plane. This includes concepts like uniform circular motion (UCM), relative velocity, and projectile motion.

2. Rectilinear Motion
Rectilinear motion refers to motion along a straight line. In this section, we cover the basic terms and concepts that are used to describe such motion:

Displacement: Displacement is a vector quantity that represents the change in position of an object. It is defined as the straight-line distance from the initial position to the final position, along with the direction. The unit of displacement is meters (m).

Path Length: Path length refers to the actual distance covered by an object as it moves along its path. Unlike displacement, path length is a scalar quantity, meaning it does not take into account the direction of motion.

Average Velocity: Average velocity is defined as the total displacement divided by the total time taken. It is a vector quantity and has both magnitude and direction. The formula for average velocity

Average Speed: Average speed is the total path length divided by the total time taken. It is a scalar quantity, which means it only considers the total distance traveled, regardless of direction. The formula is:

Average Speed
=
Total Path Length
Total Time
Average Speed= 
Total Time
Total Path Length
​
 
Instantaneous Velocity: Instantaneous velocity refers to the velocity of an object at a specific point in time. It is a vector quantity and is represented by the derivative of the displacement with respect to time.

Instantaneous Speed: Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity and gives the rate at which an object is moving at any given moment. It is a scalar quantity.

Acceleration: Acceleration is the rate at which an object’s velocity changes with time. It is a vector quantity and can be positive (speeding up), negative (slowing down), or zero (constant velocity). The formula for acceleration

3. Motion in Two Dimensions
When an object moves in a plane, it has both horizontal and vertical components of velocity and acceleration. In this section, we analyze motion in two dimensions:

Average and Instantaneous Velocities:

Average Velocity: The average velocity in two dimensions is the total displacement (in vector form) divided by the total time.
Instantaneous Velocity: This is the velocity at a specific instant, and its direction can be found from the direction of the tangent to the path at that moment.
Average and Instantaneous Acceleration:

Average Acceleration: The average acceleration in two dimensions is the change in velocity (vector) divided by the total time taken.
Instantaneous Acceleration: This is the acceleration at a specific instant in time, representing the rate of change of velocity at that instant.
Equations of Motion for an Object Traveling in a Plane with Uniform Acceleration: For an object moving with constant acceleration, the equations of motion describe its displacement, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. In two dimensions, the equations are:

𝑠

𝑡
t is time.
Relative Velocity: Relative velocity is the velocity of one object as observed from another object. It can be calculated by vector subtraction. If two objects are moving, the relative velocity between them is given by:

where

​
 
​
  is the velocity of object A relative to object B.

4. Projectile Motion
Projectile motion is the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air and is subject only to the force of gravity and air resistance. The object follows a curved path called a trajectory, which can be analyzed in horizontal and vertical components:

Horizontal motion: It is uniform, with constant velocity.
Vertical motion: It is accelerated due to gravity.
Key concepts include:

Time of flight: The time it takes for the projectile to complete its motion.
Maximum height: The highest point reached by the projectile.
Range: The horizontal distance traveled by the projectile.
5. Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)
Uniform circular motion refers to the motion of an object traveling in a circle with constant speed. While the speed remains constant, the direction of velocity continuously changes, meaning there is always an acceleration towards the center of the circle, called centripetal acceleration.

Uniform Circular Motion and Directional Changes: Even though the object moves at a constant speed, the change in direction means that there is a constant change in velocity, resulting in centripetal acceleration. This acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circular path.

Uniform Circular Motion and Centripetal Force: The force required to keep an object in uniform circular motion is called the centripetal force. This force acts toward the center of the circle and is given by:

Introduction to Laws of Motion
The laws of motion describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting on it. They also explain the motion of the body in response to those forces. These laws, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, form the foundation of classical mechanics and have wide applications in everyday life, from the movement of vehicles to the motion of planets in space.

Aristotle's Fallacy
Before Newton, the Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed that the natural state of motion for an object was rest, and a force was required to keep it moving. This idea was incorrect. According to Aristotle, when a force is removed, the object will stop moving. However, Newton's first law of motion refuted this idea by showing that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

Newton's Laws of Motion
Newton's Three Laws of Motion describe how objects move under the influence of forces:

First Law (Law of Inertia):
An object remains at rest, or in uniform motion, unless acted upon by an external force. This property of objects to resist changes in their state of motion is called inertia.

Second Law (F = ma):
The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. This law quantifies how an object will move when subjected to an external force.

Third Law (Action and Reaction):
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction.

Inertial and Non-Inertial Frames of Reference
Inertial Frame of Reference:
A reference frame in which an object not acted upon by a force remains at rest or moves with constant velocity. In other words, it follows Newton's First Law of motion.

Non-Inertial Frame of Reference:
A reference frame that is accelerating. In such frames, additional forces, known as fictitious or pseudo-forces, must be considered to explain the motion of objects.

Types of Forces
Fundamental Forces in Nature:
There are four fundamental forces in nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. Each of these forces plays a crucial role in the interactions of matter.

Contact Forces:
These forces arise when objects are in physical contact. Examples include friction, tension, normal force, and applied force.

Non-Contact Forces:
These forces act at a distance without direct physical contact. Examples include gravitational force, electromagnetic force, and nuclear forces.

Real and Pseudo Forces
Real Forces:
Forces that arise due to physical interactions, such as gravitational force or friction.

Pseudo Forces (Fictitious Forces):
Forces that are perceived when observed from a non-inertial reference frame, like the force you feel when turning a car.

Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces and Concept of Potential Energy
Conservative Forces:
Forces where the work done is independent of the path taken and only depends on the initial and final positions (e.g., gravitational force). For conservative forces, a potential energy can be defined.

Non-Conservative Forces:
Forces where the work done depends on the path taken (e.g., friction). These forces result in the dissipation of energy as heat or other forms.

Potential Energy:
The energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration, usually in relation to gravitational, electrical, or elastic forces.

Work Done by a Variable Force
When a force changes in magnitude or direction, the work done by that force is calculated by integrating the force over the displacement. For a variable force

F(x), the work done is:

𝑊

  is the initial velocity.

Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum
The total linear momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external force acts on the system. This principle is important in analyzing collisions and interactions in physics.

Collisions
A collision is an event where two or more objects exert forces on each other over a short period of time. There are two primary types:

Elastic Collision:
In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. The objects bounce off each other without any loss of kinetic energy.

Inelastic Collision:
In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not. Some kinetic energy is converted into other forms, such as heat or sound.

Coefficient of Restitution:
The coefficient of restitution (e) is a measure of how ""bouncy"" a collision is. It is defined as the relative speed after collision divided by the relative speed before collision.
Collisions in One and Two Dimensions
Elastic and Inelastic Collisions in One Dimension:
In one-dimensional collisions, objects move along a straight line. For elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. For inelastic collisions, only momentum is conserved.

Elastic and Inelastic Collisions in Two Dimensions:
In two-dimensional collisions, objects can move in different directions. The analysis is more complex but still follows the principles of conservation of momentum.

Impulse of Force
Impulse of Force:
Impulse is the product of force and the time interval over which the force acts. It causes a change in the momentum of an object. Impulse is given by:
𝐽
=
𝐹
⋅
Δ
𝑡
J=F⋅Δt
Applications of Impulse:
Impulse is used in various real-life scenarios, such as in airbags (which extend the time over which the collision occurs) or in the sport of cricket (where players need to control the impulse to stop the ball).
Rotational Analogue of a Force - Moment of a Force or Torque
Moment of a Force (Torque):
Torque is the rotational analogue of force. It is the force that causes an object to rotate about an axis. The torque is calculated as:
𝑇
=
𝐹
⋅
𝑟
⋅
sin
⁡
(
𝜃
)
T=F⋅r⋅sin(θ)
where 
𝐹
F is the force, 
𝑟
r is the distance from the axis of rotation, and 
𝜃
θ is the angle between the force and the arm.

Couple and Its Torque:
A couple is two equal and opposite forces acting at different points, creating rotational motion. The torque of a couple is independent of the axis of rotation.
Mechanical Equilibrium
An object is in mechanical equilibrium when the net force and net torque acting on it are both zero. There are three types of equilibrium:

Stable Equilibrium:
When an object returns to its original position after being displaced.

Unstable Equilibrium:
When a small displacement causes the object to move further away from its original position.

Neutral Equilibrium:
When a displacement does not affect the object's position (it remains in the new position).

Centre of Mass and Centre of Gravity
Centre of Mass:
The center of mass of an object is the point where the total mass of the object can be considered to be concentrated. It is the average position of all the mass in the object.

Centre of Gravity:
The centre of gravity is the point where the force of gravity acts on an object. In uniform gravitational fields, the centre of mass and centre of gravity coincide.

Centre of Gravity of Some Regular Uniform Objects:
For simple objects, such as spheres, cubes, or rods, the center of gravity lies at specific points, such as the geometric center.

Centre of Gravity and the Balance Point:
The center of gravity of an object determines its balance point. An object will balance when its centre of gravity is directly above the pivot point.

Determination of Centre of Gravity of an Irregular Lamina:
The centre of gravity of an irregular object can be determined using a balance method with a plumb line.

Real-Life Applications of Centre of Gravity
The concept of the center of gravity is essential in designing stable structures, such as buildings, bridges, vehicles, and sports equipment. It is used to ensure that objects or structures do not topple over under normal conditions.",1385,6,"Laws of Motion

,,,CHAPTER 5- GRAVITATION,"Introduction to Gravitation
Gravitation is the force of attraction between any two masses. It is one of the fundamental forces of nature and is responsible for the motion of celestial bodies and the behavior of objects on Earth. Sir Isaac Newton's law of gravitation provides the most comprehensive explanation for the force of gravity, extending the ideas of earlier scientists such as Kepler.

Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
1. Kepler's First Law: The Law of Ellipses Kepler’s First Law states that the orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the two foci. This challenges the earlier belief that planets moved in circular orbits. An ellipse is an elongated circle, characterized by its two foci.

2. Kepler's Second Law: The Law of Equal Areas Kepler’s Second Law, or the Law of Equal Areas, states that a line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals. This means that the planet moves faster when it is closer to the Sun and slower when it is farther away, keeping the area swept by the line constant.

3. Kepler's Third Law: The Law of Harmonies Kepler's Third Law establishes a relationship between the time a planet takes to orbit the Sun (orbital period) and its average distance from the Sun. It states that the square of the orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (average distance) of the orbit. Mathematically, it is represented as:

𝑇
2
∝
𝑟
3
T 
2
 ∝r 
3
 
where 
𝑇
T is the orbital period and 
𝑟
r is the semi-major axis.

4. Kepler's Laws and Newton's Explanation Newton used Kepler’s Laws to develop his Universal Law of Gravitation. While Kepler’s Laws provided the empirical rules for planetary motion, Newton’s theory gave a theoretical explanation, attributing planetary motion to the force of gravity.

Effects of Newton's Law of Gravitation
Newton’s Law of Gravitation helps explain a variety of phenomena:

It explains why objects fall toward the Earth.
It governs the motion of celestial bodies, including the orbits of planets, moons, and artificial satellites.
It accounts for the tides on Earth due to the gravitational pull of the Moon.
Centre of Mass and Gravity
The center of mass of an object is the point where its mass can be considered to be concentrated for the purposes of analysis. The force of gravity acts on the center of mass of an object. For an extended body like a planet or satellite, gravity acts as though it is concentrated at its center of mass.

Measurement of the Gravitational Constant (G)
The gravitational constant 
𝐺
G was first measured by Henry Cavendish in 1798 using a torsion balance experiment. The value of 
𝐺
G is crucial for calculating gravitational forces between masses, especially in astronomical contexts.

Acceleration Due to Gravity (g)
Introduction The acceleration due to gravity, denoted 
𝑔
g, is the acceleration experienced by an object due to Earth's gravitational pull. On the surface of the Earth, the average value of 
𝑔
g is approximately 
9.8

Value of g on the Surface of the Earth The acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is 
𝑔
=
9.8
 
m/s
2
g=9.8m/s 
2
 . This value is an average because the actual value varies slightly depending on location (altitude, latitude, and Earth's shape).

Variation in the Value of g The value of 
𝑔
g is not constant everywhere on Earth. It can vary based on factors like altitude, depth, latitude, and the Earth's shape.

Variation in g with Altitude: As you move higher above Earth's surface (e.g., on a mountain or in an airplane), the distance from the center of the Earth increases, and gravity weakens. Thus, 
𝑔
g decreases with altitude.
Variation in g with Depth: As you go deeper into the Earth, gravity decreases because the mass of the Earth beneath you decreases.
Variation in g with Latitude and Rotation of the Earth: Gravity is slightly weaker at the equator due to the Earth’s rotation and its oblate shape (flattened at the poles). The centrifugal force due to Earth's rotation reduces the effective gravitational force at the equator.
Gravitational Potential and Potential Energy

R is the radius of the Earth.
The escape velocity at the Earth's surface is approximately 11.2 km/s.

Earth Satellites
Projection of Satellite A satellite in orbit around Earth is projected at a speed and direction such that it continuously ""falls"" toward Earth but also moves forward fast enough to avoid hitting the surface, resulting in a stable orbit.

Weightlessness in a Satellite Astronauts aboard a satellite experience weightlessness because both they and the satellite are in free fall. Although gravity still acts on them, they do not feel its effect because they are not resisting it; they are accelerating toward Earth at the same rate as the satellite.

Time Period of a Satellite The time period 
𝑇
T of a satellite (the time it takes to complete one orbit) depends on the altitude of the satellite. The orbital period is related to the radius 
𝑟
r of the orbit by Kepler's Third Law.

Binding Energy of an Orbiting Satellite The binding energy of a satellite is the energy required to move it from its orbit to infinity (where it would be free from Earth's gravity).

,,,CHAPTER 6- MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS,"Chapter 6: Mechanical Properties of Solids
Introduction to Mechanical Properties of Solids:

Mechanical properties of solids refer to the behavior of a solid material when subjected to different forces or stresses. These properties define how materials deform, break, or resist changes when external forces are applied. Understanding these properties is crucial in engineering and physics for designing structures, materials, and components that must withstand various stresses.

Elastic Behavior of Solids:
Solids exhibit elastic behavior when they return to their original shape and size after the removal of a deforming force. This happens within the elastic limit, beyond which the material may experience permanent deformation or break. Elasticity is a key property of materials that allows them to recover after being deformed under stress.

Stress and Strain:
When a force is applied to a solid, it experiences stress and strain:

Stress is the force applied per unit area of the material.
Strain is the relative deformation of the material due to the applied stress.
Stress:
Stress is defined as the force applied to a unit area and can be categorized into several types:

Longitudinal Stress:

Tensile Stress: When a material is stretched by a force, it experiences tensile stress, which tries to elongate the material.
Compressive Stress: When a material is compressed by a force, it experiences compressive stress, which tries to shorten the material.
Hydraulic or Volume Stress:

This type of stress involves a change in the volume of a material due to pressure changes, especially in fluids.
Shear or Tangential Stress:

Shear stress occurs when a force is applied tangentially (parallel) to the surface of the material, causing it to slide along the direction of the force.
Breaking Stress:

The stress at which a material breaks or fractures under the applied load is called breaking stress.
Strain:
Strain is the measure of the deformation or displacement of particles in a material when subjected to stress. There are several types of strain:

Longitudinal (Tensile or Linear) Strain:

This strain occurs when a material is stretched or compressed along its length. It is defined as the change in length divided by the original length.
Volume Strain:

Volume strain occurs when there is a change in the volume of a material, usually under pressure. It is the change in volume divided by the original volume.
Shear Strain:

Shear strain occurs when there is a change in the shape of a material without changing its volume. It is defined as the angle by which the material deforms due to shear stress.
Hooke's Law:
Hooke's Law states that the stress applied to a solid is directly proportional to the strain produced within the elastic limit. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

Stress
=
Elastic Modulus
×
Strain
Stress=Elastic Modulus×Strain
This law forms the foundation for understanding elastic deformation in materials.

Elastic Modulus:
Elastic moduli are constants that describe the stiffness of a material. They represent the material's ability to resist deformation under stress. The major types of elastic moduli are:

Young's Modulus (Y):

Also known as the modulus of elasticity, it measures the material's ability to resist changes in length under tension or compression. It is the ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain.
Bulk Modulus (K):

Bulk modulus measures a material's resistance to uniform compression. It is the ratio of volumetric stress to the corresponding change in volume (volume strain).
Modulus of Rigidity (η):

Also known as the shear modulus, it measures a material's ability to resist shear stress. It is the ratio of shear stress to shear strain.
Poisson's Ratio (ν):

Poisson's ratio is the ratio of lateral strain (change in diameter) to longitudinal strain (change in length) when the material is stretched or compressed.
Stress-Strain Curve:
The stress-strain curve represents the relationship between the applied stress and the resulting strain in a material. It helps to understand how a material behaves under different levels of stress:

Elastic Region: The initial part of the curve, where stress is proportional to strain, and the material returns to its original shape once the stress is removed.
Plastic Region: Beyond the elastic limit, the material starts to deform permanently, and it cannot return to its original shape.
Breaking Point: The point where the material fractures or breaks due to excessive stress.
Strain Energy:
Strain energy refers to the energy stored in a material when it is deformed under stress. It is calculated as the work done by the applied force to deform the material. In the elastic region, the energy is fully recoverable when the material returns to its original shape.

Hardness:
Hardness is a measure of a material's resistance to indentation or scratching. Materials with higher hardness values are more resistant to surface wear and deformation. Several hardness scales are used to measure hardness, such as the Mohs scale (used for minerals) and Brinell or Rockwell scales (used for metals).

Friction in Solids:
Friction is the force that resists the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. It arises from the interaction between the microscopic roughness of surfaces.

Origin of Friction:
Friction is caused by the microscopic asperities (irregularities) on surfaces. When two surfaces come in contact, these asperities interlock, and force is required to overcome this interlocking and cause relative motion.

Types of Friction:
Static Friction:

Static friction is the force that resists the initiation of motion between two surfaces. It is generally higher than kinetic friction.
Kinetic Friction:

Kinetic friction is the force that resists the motion once two surfaces have already started moving relative to each other. It is generally constant for a given set of materials.
Rolling Friction:

Rolling friction occurs when an object rolls over a surface, as opposed to sliding. It is usually much smaller than sliding friction and is the reason why wheels or ball bearings are used in many applications.",969,5,"Stress

Introduction to Thermal Properties of Matter
Thermal properties of matter describe how matter responds to changes in temperature and how it interacts with heat. These properties play a critical role in understanding the behavior of substances when they are heated or cooled. The key thermal properties include heat, temperature, expansion, specific heat capacity, and phase changes.

Heat and Temperature
Introduction
Heat and temperature are fundamental concepts in thermal physics, but they are not the same.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. It determines the direction of heat flow. A higher temperature corresponds to more energetic particles.
Heat refers to the energy transferred from one object to another due to a difference in temperature. Heat always flows from the object with higher temperature to the object with lower temperature.
Experiment: Measurement of Temperature
Various devices are used to measure temperature, including:

Thermometers: These devices contain liquids (like mercury or alcohol) that expand when heated, allowing us to measure temperature changes.
Thermistors: These are resistors that change resistance with temperature and are commonly used in digital thermometers.
Absolute Temperature and Ideal Gas Equation
Absolute Zero: Theoretically, it is the lowest possible temperature where particles have minimal motion. This temperature is defined as 0 Kelvin (-273.15°C).

Specific Heat Capacity
Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius (or Kelvin). It is denoted as 
𝑐
c and is measured in J/kg·K.

The formula for heat required to change the temperature of a substance is:

ΔT is the change in temperature.
Calorimetry
Calorimetry is the science of measuring heat changes in physical and chemical processes.

Principle of Calorimetry: The principle is based on the law of conservation of energy, which states that the total heat lost by hot substances equals the total heat gained by cold substances.

Temperature of Mixture in Different Cases:

If two substances of different temperatures are mixed, the heat lost by the hotter substance is equal to the heat gained by the cooler substance.
The final temperature can be calculated by using the equation:

Change of State
When matter changes from one phase to another (solid, liquid, gas), energy is either absorbed or released without changing the temperature.

From Point A to B: This phase change occurs without a temperature change (e.g., melting of ice). The energy required for this change is called latent heat.

From Point B to D: This represents the further heating of a substance in the liquid phase.

Sublimation: This is the direct transition from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase (e.g., dry ice).

Phase Diagram
A phase diagram shows the phases of a substance at different temperatures and pressures. It consists of the following curves:

Vapourisation Curve (1-v): The boundary between the liquid and gas phases.
Fusion Curve (1-s): The boundary between the solid and liquid phases.
Sublimation Curve (V): The boundary between the solid and gas phases.
Triple Point: The point where all three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) coexist.
Gas and Vapour
Latent Heat: This is the heat required to change the state of a unit mass of a substance at constant temperature. It is of two types:
Latent Heat of Fusion: The heat required to change a substance from solid to liquid.
Latent Heat of Vaporisation: The heat required to change a substance from liquid to gas.
Heat Transfer
Heat can transfer from one object to another by three primary mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation.

Conduction:

Thermal Conductivity: It is the property of a material that defines the rate at which heat is conducted through it. Materials like metals have high thermal conductivity.

Coefficient of Thermal Conductivity: This is the constant of proportionality in the equation:

d is the distance between them.

Thermal Resistance (RT): The resistance to heat flow is inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity.

Convection:

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of fluids (liquids or gases). It occurs when hot fluid rises, and cooler fluid sinks, creating a flow.
Free and Forced Convection: Free convection occurs due to natural fluid movement (e.g., warm air rising), while forced convection uses external forces (e.g., a fan).
Radiation:

Heat can also be transferred by electromagnetic waves, known as radiation. All objects emit radiation depending on their temperature.

Newton's Law of Cooling: This law states that the rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings:

,,,CHAPTER 8- SOUND,"Chapter 8: Sound

Introduction to Sound
Sound is a type of mechanical wave that requires a medium to propagate. It travels as vibrations through materials such as air, water, and solids. It is essential to understand the nature of sound waves, their properties, and how they interact with different environments.

Types of Waves
Waves can be classified based on their propagation and nature:

Mechanical Waves: These require a medium to travel through (e.g., air, water, solids). Sound waves are mechanical waves, as they rely on the vibration of molecules in a medium.

Electromagnetic (EM) Waves: These do not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum (e.g., light, radio waves). They propagate by oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

Matter Waves: These are associated with particles of matter, described by quantum mechanics, where particles like electrons exhibit wave-like properties.

Common Properties of All Waves
Amplitude (A): The maximum displacement of a wave from its rest position. It determines the energy carried by the wave.

Wavelength (λ): The distance between two consecutive points in phase on the wave, such as crest to crest or trough to trough.

Period (T): The time it takes for one complete oscillation of the wave.

Frequency (n): The number of oscillations or cycles the wave completes per unit time. It is the inverse of the period: 
𝑛
=
1
/
𝑇
n=1/T.

Velocity (v): The speed at which the wave propagates through the medium. For sound, it is calculated by the formula 
𝑣
=
𝜆
⋅
𝑛
v=λ⋅n.

Phase and Phase Difference: The phase refers to the position of a point within one wave cycle. Phase difference is the difference in the phase between two waves at the same point.

Characteristics of Progressive Waves
A progressive wave is one that moves through a medium, transferring energy without transferring matter. It has the following characteristics:

Transverse Waves: In these waves, the displacement of particles is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation (e.g., light waves).
Longitudinal Waves: Here, the displacement of particles is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves are longitudinal.

The Speed of Travelling Waves
The speed of a wave depends on the properties of the medium it travels through.

Speed of Transverse Waves: The speed of a transverse wave on a string is given by:
𝑣
=
𝑇
𝜇
v= 
μ
T
​
 
​
 
where 
𝑇
T is the tension in the string and 
𝜇
μ is the mass per unit length of the string.

Speed of Longitudinal Waves (Sound Waves): The speed of sound in a medium is given by:
𝑣
=
𝐵
𝜌
v= 
ρ
B
​
 
​
 
where 
𝐵
B is the bulk modulus (a measure of the material's resistance to compression) and 
𝜌
ρ is the density of the medium.

Newton's Formula for Velocity of Sound
Newton proposed that the velocity of sound in air is:

𝑣
=
𝛾
𝑃
𝜌
v= 
ρ
γP
​
 
​
 
where:

𝛾
γ is the ratio of specific heats (approximately 1.4 for air),
𝑃
P is the pressure of the medium,
𝜌
ρ is the density of the medium.
Laplace's Correction
Laplace corrected Newton's formula by accounting for the fact that sound propagation is adiabatic (no heat exchange). The corrected formula is:

𝑣
=
𝛾
𝑃
𝜌
v= 
ρ
γP
​
 
​
 
but the value of 
𝛾
γ is slightly different for an adiabatic process.

Factors Affecting the Speed of Sound
Effect of Pressure on Velocity of Sound: In an ideal gas, the speed of sound is independent of pressure, as both the pressure and density increase proportionally.

Effect of Temperature on Speed of Sound: The speed of sound increases with temperature because warmer molecules vibrate more quickly, facilitating the propagation of sound. The formula for sound speed as a function of temperature 
𝑇
T is:

𝑣
=
𝛾
𝑅
𝑇
𝑀
v= 
M
γRT
​
 
​
 
where 
𝑅
R is the gas constant, 
𝑀
M is the molar mass of air, and 
𝑇
T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Effect of Humidity on Speed of Sound: Higher humidity reduces the density of air (since water vapor is less dense than dry air), thereby increasing the speed of sound.
Principle of Superposition of Waves
The superposition principle states that when two or more waves meet, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves.

Some Important Terms:
Phase: The position of a point within a wave cycle.
Phase Difference: The difference in phase between two waves at a given point.
Path Difference: The difference in the distance traveled by two waves from their respective sources to a given point.
The resultant amplitude due to superposition is found by adding the amplitudes of the individual waves. The resultant intensity is proportional to the square of the resultant amplitude.

Echo, Reverberation, and Acoustics
Echo: The reflection of sound from a surface, heard as a distinct repetition after a delay.
Reverberation: The persistence of sound in a space due to multiple reflections.
Acoustics refers to the study of sound in enclosed spaces. Good acoustics are crucial in architecture, especially in concert halls and lecture theaters.

Medical Applications of Acoustics
Acoustic waves are used in medical imaging (e.g., ultrasound) to produce images of internal organs or to treat various conditions (e.g., kidney stone fragmentation).

Qualities of Sound
Pitch: Related to the frequency of the sound wave, higher frequencies correspond to higher pitches.
Timbre: Also called ""sound quality,"" it is what allows us to distinguish different sources of sound (e.g., a violin vs. a piano playing the same note).
Loudness: Determined by the amplitude of the sound wave, louder sounds have larger amplitudes.
Doppler Effect
The Doppler Effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It is commonly observed with sound waves:

Source Moving, Listener Stationary: The frequency increases if the source approaches the observer and decreases if it recedes.
Listener Approaching a Stationary Source: The listener perceives a higher frequency as they move toward the sound source.
Both Source and Listener Moving: The frequency change depends on the relative velocities of both the source and the listener.
Common Properties between Doppler Effect of Sound and Light
Both sound and light waves experience a frequency shift due to relative motion. However, the speed of light is much higher than the speed of sound.

Major Differences between Doppler Effects of Sound and Light
The Doppler shift for sound depends on the speed of the medium (air), while for light, it depends on the relative velocity between the source and the observer.
The Doppler effect in sound can be influenced by the medium, such as wind velocity, whereas the Doppler effect in light is not.
Applications of Doppler's Effect
Radar: Used to measure the speed of objects.
Medical Imaging: Ultrasound Doppler shifts help measure blood flow.
Astronomy: The Doppler effect helps measure the velocity of stars and galaxies.",1259,6,"Sound

,,,CHAPTER 9- OPTICS,"Chapter 9: Optics
Optics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of light, its properties, behavior, and its interaction with various materials. It is traditionally divided into two main branches: Ray Optics (Geometrical Optics) and Wave Optics. The study of light involves understanding its nature and how it behaves when it interacts with different media. This chapter introduces key concepts like the nature of light, reflection, refraction, total internal reflection, lenses, and optical instruments.

1. Introduction to Ray Optics
Ray Optics deals with the study of light propagation in terms of rays. Light behaves like a stream of rays when passing through transparent media. It explains the phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and the formation of images by mirrors and lenses. Ray Optics assumes that the wavelength of light is much smaller than the size of the objects involved, and thus treats light as straight lines (rays).

2. Light and its Sources
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation visible to the human eye. It can originate from different sources, including natural sources like the sun and artificial sources like bulbs. These sources emit light in various forms, such as continuous or discrete spectra, and exhibit properties like intensity, color, and polarization.

3. Nature of Light
Light has three primary natures:

Corpuscular Nature: Proposed by Isaac Newton, this theory suggests that light consists of particles called ""corpuscles."" According to this theory, light behaves like a stream of tiny particles.

Wave Nature: Proposed by Christiaan Huygens, this theory suggests that light is a wave, similar to sound or water waves. It can undergo interference and diffraction, which supports its wave-like behavior.

Dual Nature: The modern understanding of light combines both the wave and particle nature. This is known as the ""Dual Nature of Light,"" as demonstrated by phenomena like the photoelectric effect (particle behavior) and interference (wave behavior).

4. Ray Optics or Geometrical Optics
Ray Optics studies the behavior of light as it travels along straight lines, known as rays. The main concepts of Ray Optics include:

Reflection: This occurs when light bounces off a surface. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

Refraction: Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another. The change in speed of light as it enters a different medium causes this bending, and it can be described using Snell’s Law.

5. Cartesian Sign Convention
This is a convention used to define the distances and angles in Ray Optics. The convention assigns positive and negative values to different distances and angles to standardize the descriptions of optical phenomena.

6. Reflection
Reflection occurs when light strikes a surface and bounces back. It follows these key rules:

The angle of incidence (θi) is equal to the angle of reflection (θr).
Reflection can occur from plane surfaces (flat mirrors) or curved surfaces (concave or convex mirrors).
7. Reflection from Curved Mirrors
Curved mirrors, such as concave and convex mirrors, can cause light to converge or diverge. In concave mirrors, parallel rays converge at a focal point, while in convex mirrors, rays diverge after reflection.

8. Refraction
Refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another, changing its speed and direction. This bending is governed by the refractive indices of the media involved and can be described mathematically by Snell’s Law:

​
  are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

9. Total Internal Reflection
Total internal reflection occurs when a light ray traveling through a denser medium hits a boundary with a less dense medium at an angle greater than the critical angle. This results in the light being completely reflected within the denser medium. This principle is essential for technologies like optical fibers.

Essential conditions for total internal reflection: It occurs only when light moves from a denser medium to a rarer medium and when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle.

Applications of Total Internal Reflection: This phenomenon is used in optical fibers for communication and in the formation of rainbows.

10. Dispersion of Light and Prisms
Dispersion occurs when light splits into its component colors as it passes through a medium like a prism. This happens because different wavelengths of light bend by different amounts, creating a spectrum. A prism is commonly used to demonstrate this phenomenon.

11. Natural Phenomena Due to Sunlight
Mirage: A mirage is a natural optical illusion caused by the refraction of light in the atmosphere, often seen on hot days when light rays bend due to varying temperatures.
Rainbow: A rainbow is formed when sunlight undergoes dispersion, reflection, and refraction through water droplets in the atmosphere, producing a spectrum of colors.
12. Defects of Lenses
Lenses can have imperfections, known as aberrations, which affect the clarity and sharpness of images.

Chromatic Aberration: This occurs when different colors of light are focused at different points due to the varying refractive indices for different wavelengths.

Spherical Aberration: It arises when light rays passing through the edges of a spherical lens focus at different points compared to those passing through the center.

13. Optical Instruments
Optical instruments are devices that use lenses and mirrors to magnify objects or focus light. Some important optical instruments include:

Simple Microscope: A magnifying lens that helps to observe small objects. It works by forming a virtual image that appears larger than the object.

Near Point Focusing: The closest point at which the human eye can focus on an object.
Normal Focusing: Focusing an object at the normal near point (25 cm from the eye).
Resolving Power of Microscope: The ability to distinguish between two points as separate.
Compound Microscope: A microscope with two or more lenses to achieve higher magnification.

Telescope: A device used for viewing distant objects, especially celestial bodies.

,,,CHAPTER 10- ELECTROSTATICS,"Chapter 10: Electrostatics
Introduction to Electrostatics
Electrostatics is the study of stationary electric charges or charges at rest. It deals with the forces and fields created by these charges, and the interactions that occur between them. It lays the foundation for understanding electrical phenomena and is critical in fields like electronics, electromagnetism, and more.

Electric Charges
Electric charges are fundamental properties of matter that cause it to experience a force when placed in an electric and magnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. These charges interact in specific ways:

Like charges repel each other.
Opposite charges attract each other.
Point Charge
A point charge is an idealized charge that has a very small size (practically considered to be of zero dimensions). The effects of a point charge can be described using Coulomb's law.

Test Charge
A test charge is a small charge used to measure the electric field around a source charge without disturbing it. It is typically considered to be of negligible magnitude.

Basic Properties of Electric Charge
Additive Nature of Charge: The total charge in a system is the sum of individual charges. Charges are additive in nature.
Quantization of Charge: Charge is quantized, meaning it exists only in discrete amounts. The smallest unit of charge is the charge of an electron or proton, denoted as e = 
1.6

10
−
19
1.6×10 
−19
  coulombs.
Conservation of Charge: Charge cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one body to another.
Forces between Charges
The force between two charges depends on the amount of charge on each object and the distance between them.

Coulomb's Law - Force Between Two Point Charges
Coulomb's law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force 
𝐹
F between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it is given by:

Scalar form of Coulomb's Law
The scalar form simply gives the magnitude of the force without considering its direction. It assumes that the force is along the line connecting the charges.

Relative Permittivity or Dielectric Constant
The relative permittivity (or dielectric constant) is a measure of the resistance that a medium offers to the formation of an electric field within it. A higher dielectric constant means that the medium can reduce the force between charges more effectively.

Definition of Unit Charge from Coulomb's Law
The unit charge is the charge that experiences a force of 
1
 
N
1N when placed in an electric field of 
1
 
N/C
1N/C.

Coulomb's Law in Vector Form
The vector form of Coulomb's law considers the direction of the force. It states that the force between two point charges is a vector quantity and points along the line joining the charges. The formula is:

Principle of Superposition
The principle of superposition states that when multiple charges are present, the total force on a charge is the vector sum of the individual forces exerted on it by all other charges.

Electric Field
An electric field is a field that surrounds electric charges and exerts a force on other charges placed in the field.

Practical Way of Calculating Electric Field
The electric field can be calculated by dividing the force experienced by a test charge by the magnitude of the test charge.

Electric Lines of Force
Electric lines of force are imaginary lines used to represent the electric field. These lines begin on positive charges and end on negative charges. They never intersect and the density of the lines indicates the strength of the field.

,,,CHAPTER 11- ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH CONDUCTORS,"Chapter 11: Electric Current Through Conductors
Electric Current
Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor, typically in the form of electrons moving through a wire. The flow of current is due to the movement of charge carriers in response to an electric field applied across the conductor. The basic unit of electric current is the Ampere (A), named after André-Marie Ampère, a French physicist and mathematician, who was a pioneer in the study of electromagnetism.

Ampere: Pioneer of Electric Current Measurement
The Ampere is the SI unit of electric current.
One Ampere is defined as the flow of one Coulomb of charge per second.
It is the fundamental unit used to measure the rate of flow of electric charge.
Flow of Current Through a Conductor
Current flows through a conductor when there is a potential difference (voltage) between its two ends. This difference pushes the free electrons in the conductor, causing them to move, thus creating a current.
The flow of current depends on factors such as the material of the conductor, its length, temperature, and cross-sectional area.
Drift Speed
The drift speed refers to the average speed at which electrons move in response to an applied electric field. In a conductor, electrons move in random directions due to thermal motion, but the application of an electric field causes them to drift in a particular direction, resulting in current.
The drift speed is generally very small (on the order of millimeters per second).
Ohm's Law (V = IR)
Ohm’s Law states that the current (I) passing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across it and inversely proportional to its resistance (R).
Mathematically, it is expressed as:
𝑉
=
𝐼
𝑅
V=IR
where:
V is the voltage (in volts),
I is the current (in amperes),
R is the resistance (in ohms, Ω).
Ohm’s Law is fundamental in understanding how electrical circuits behave.
Limitations of Ohm's Law
Ohm’s Law holds true for ohmic conductors—materials that have a constant resistance, independent of current or voltage.
However, for non-ohmic conductors (such as diodes and thermistors), the relationship between current and voltage is not linear, and Ohm's Law does not apply.
Electrical Power
Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy (like heat, light, etc.) in an electrical circuit.

The formula for power in an electrical circuit is:

𝑃
=
𝑉
𝐼
P=VI
where:

P is the power (in watts),
V is the voltage (in volts),
I is the current (in amperes).

𝑅

These equations show that power can be determined from current, voltage, or resistance.

Power-Voltage Rating
The power-voltage rating of an electrical appliance specifies the voltage at which the appliance operates and the maximum power it consumes at that voltage.

where:
E is energy in joules,
P is power in watts,
t is time in seconds.
Units of Electrical Power
The unit of electrical power is the watt (W), which is equal to one joule per second (J/s).
Resistors

​
 
where:

Rheostat
A rheostat is a variable resistor used to adjust the current flowing in a circuit by changing the resistance. It is often used in dimmer switches and motor speed controllers.
Combination of Resistors
Resistors can be combined in two main ways: series combination and parallel combination.

Series Combination of Resistors:
In a series combination, the resistors are connected end-to-end. The total resistance (R_total) is the sum of the individual resistances:

Specific Resistance (Resistivity)
Resistivity (ρ) is a property of a material that quantifies how strongly the material opposes the flow of electric current. It depends on the material and temperature.

Electromotive Force (emf)
Electromotive force (emf) is the energy supplied per unit charge by a source (such as a battery or generator) to move charges around a circuit. It is measured in volts and represents the potential energy per unit charge available to push the current.
Combination of Cells in Series and in Parallel
Cells can be combined in series or parallel to achieve desired voltage or current.
Series Combination of Cells:

When cells are connected in series, their emfs add up, but the internal resistance also increases. The total voltage is the sum of the individual cell voltages.

,,,CHAPTER 12- MAGNETISM,"Chapter 12: Magnetism
1. Introduction to Magnetism
Magnetism is a force that causes materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt to attract or repel each other. The force is produced by moving electric charges, primarily electrons. Magnetism is a fundamental force of nature, just like gravity and electric forces. It is closely related to electricity and is governed by electromagnetic theory.

2. Earth's Magnetic Field and Magnetic Elements
The Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet, having a magnetic field that extends into space. This magnetic field is what makes compasses work, guiding navigators by pointing towards the Earth's magnetic poles. The magnetic field of the Earth is created by the movement of molten iron in the outer core of the Earth, generating a geomagnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field varies at different points on Earth.

Magnetic elements refer to the basic components that describe the behavior of magnetic fields, including the magnetic poles, field lines, and the strength of the magnetic field.

3. Basic Properties of Magnets
A magnet is any material that produces a magnetic field. Some common properties of magnets include:

Attraction and Repulsion: Like poles of a magnet repel each other, while opposite poles attract each other.
Polarity: Every magnet has two poles, the North Pole (N) and the South Pole (S). If a magnet is cut in half, each half will become a magnet with its own North and South poles.
4. Magnetic Lines of Force and Magnetic Field
Magnetic lines of force are invisible lines that represent the direction of the magnetic field. These lines:

Start from the North Pole of a magnet and end at the South Pole.
Never cross each other.
Form closed loops, curving outside the magnet and inside it, connecting the two poles.
The magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving charges and materials. It is represented by the magnetic field lines, and its strength is measured in teslas (T).

5. The Bar Magnet
A bar magnet is a simple form of a magnet, often rectangular in shape, with two magnetic poles—north and south. The magnetic field of a bar magnet can be observed using iron filings or a compass. The field lines emerge from the North Pole and curve towards the South Pole.

6. The Magnetic Field Lines
Magnetic field lines are an essential concept in understanding magnetism. They illustrate the direction of the magnetic force at any given point. The lines are denser at the poles, where the magnetic field is stronger, and become less dense as they move away from the poles. These lines show that the magnetic force is radial and extends from the poles.

7. Bar Magnet as an Equivalent Solenoid
A solenoid is a coil of wire that produces a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. A bar magnet is similar to a solenoid because the magnetic field produced by both is alike. The magnetic field lines around a solenoid resemble the field lines of a bar magnet, where they are straight in the center of the coil and loop around the ends.

8. The Dipole in a Uniform Magnetic Field
A magnetic dipole consists of two opposite magnetic poles separated by a distance. When placed in a uniform magnetic field, the dipole experiences a torque that causes it to align with the magnetic field. The torque is proportional to the strength of the field and the magnetic moment of the dipole.

9. The Electrostatic Analog
The concept of magnetic fields is often compared to electric fields, which are produced by charges. While electric fields are produced by static charges, magnetic fields are created by moving charges. Both fields have a similar mathematical framework, but their effects are different—electric fields cause attraction or repulsion between charges, while magnetic fields affect moving charges.

10. Magnetic Potential
Magnetic potential refers to the potential energy per unit magnetic moment in a magnetic field. It describes how much energy is stored in a magnetic field and is related to the magnetic field strength and the position of the dipole within the field.

11. Gauss' Law of Magnetism
Gauss's Law for magnetism states that the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero. In other words, there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated magnetic poles). This law suggests that magnetic field lines always form closed loops, meaning that magnetic field lines that exit a magnet from one pole must return through the other pole.

12. Earth's Magnetism
Earth's magnetic field is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, influencing compasses and navigation. It is thought to be generated by the movement of molten iron and other metals in the Earth's outer core, producing a dynamo effect that creates the geomagnetic field.

,,,CHAPTER 14- SEMICONDUCTORS,"Chapter 14: Semiconductors
Semiconductors play a crucial role in modern electronics, forming the foundation for devices like transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits. This chapter delves into the essential concepts of semiconductors, their properties, and their applications.

Introduction to Semiconductors
A semiconductor is a material whose electrical conductivity lies between that of a conductor (like metals) and an insulator (like rubber). Semiconductors are essential in electronics because their conductivity can be controlled by adding impurities, creating extrinsic semiconductors.

Electrical Conduction in Solids
The ability of a material to conduct electricity depends on the presence of free charge carriers. In conductors, the electrons in the outer shells of atoms are loosely bound, allowing them to move freely and conduct electricity. In insulators, the electrons are tightly bound, making it difficult for them to move and conduct electricity. Semiconductors fall between these two extremes.

Conductors (Metals)
In metals, conduction occurs when electrons move through the lattice of atoms in the metal. These electrons are not bound to any particular atom and can move freely in the material. Metals are good conductors because they have many free electrons that allow the flow of electric current.

Insulators
Insulators are materials where the outer electrons of atoms are tightly bound, preventing them from moving freely. Examples of insulators include rubber, plastic, and wood. These materials resist the flow of electric current and are used to prevent unintended current flow in circuits.

Semiconductors
Semiconductors are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of conductors and insulators. They are typically made from elements like silicon and germanium. Semiconductors have a small number of free charge carriers at room temperature, but their conductivity can be increased by adding impurities (doping).

Band Theory of Solids
The Band Theory explains the behavior of electrons in solid materials. According to this theory:

Valence Band: The outermost band of electrons that are involved in chemical bonding.
Conduction Band: A higher energy band where electrons are free to move and conduct electricity.
Forbidden Band (Band Gap): The energy gap between the valence and conduction bands, where no electron states exist.
In semiconductors, the band gap is small enough that electrons can jump from the valence band to the conduction band, allowing them to contribute to electrical conduction under certain conditions (such as by applying heat or external voltage).

Intrinsic Semiconductor
An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor with no impurities added. In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons is equal to the number of holes (missing electrons that create positive charge carriers). These semiconductors exhibit limited conductivity at room temperature.

Holes in semiconductors refer to the absence of an electron in the valence band. When an electron is excited into the conduction band, it leaves behind a ""hole"" in the valence band, which acts as a positive charge carrier.
Extrinsic Semiconductor
An extrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor that has been doped with impurities to increase its electrical conductivity. The type of doping determines whether the semiconductor will have an excess of electrons (n-type) or holes (p-type).

Doping is the process of intentionally introducing impurities into a semiconductor material to alter its electrical properties.
Types of Doping
Pentavalent Dopants: These are impurities that have five valence electrons (such as phosphorus or arsenic). When added to a semiconductor like silicon, these dopants donate an extra electron to the conduction band, creating an n-type semiconductor (negative-type semiconductor), where the majority charge carriers are electrons.

Trivalent Dopants: These are impurities with three valence electrons (such as boron or gallium). When added to a semiconductor, they create ""holes"" in the crystal lattice, resulting in a p-type semiconductor (positive-type semiconductor), where the majority charge carriers are holes.

Extrinsic Semiconductors
Extrinsic semiconductors are categorized based on the type of doping:

n-type Semiconductor: Doped with pentavalent atoms (such as phosphorus) to add extra electrons. The majority carriers are electrons, and the material is negatively charged.

p-type Semiconductor: Doped with trivalent atoms (such as boron) to create holes. The majority carriers are holes, and the material is positively charged.

The Conductivity of Semiconductors (σ)
The conductivity (σ) of a semiconductor is determined by the number of charge carriers (electrons or holes) available to carry the current. In intrinsic semiconductors, the conductivity is limited by the number of thermally excited charge carriers. In extrinsic semiconductors, conductivity increases significantly due to the doping process, which provides more free charge carriers.

Charge Neutrality of Extrinsic Semiconductors
In extrinsic semiconductors, the total number of electrons and holes must balance. This means that the number of negatively charged electrons must be equal to the number of positively charged holes, ensuring that the semiconductor remains electrically neutral.

p-n Junction
A p-n junction is formed when p-type and n-type semiconductors are brought together. The boundary where the two types meet is called the depletion region, and it creates a built-in electric field that controls the flow of charge carriers.

Formation of p-n Junction: When p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined, electrons from the n-type region diffuse into the p-type region and recombine with holes, forming a depletion region that acts as an insulator.
A p-n Junction Diode
A p-n junction diode is a semiconductor device that allows current to flow in one direction only. When forward biased, the p-n junction allows current to pass through; when reverse biased, the current is blocked.

Semiconductor Devices
Semiconductors are the building blocks for various electronic devices. Some common semiconductor devices include:

Diodes: Allow current to flow in only one direction.
Transistors: Used to amplify signals and act as switches.
Solar Cells: Convert light energy into electrical energy.
Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs): Emit light when current flows through them.
Applications of Semiconductors and p-n Junction Diodes
Semiconductors have numerous applications in modern technology. Some of the common uses of semiconductors and p-n junction diodes include:

Rectifiers: Used in power supplies to convert AC to DC.
Signal Detectors: In radio and communication devices.
Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs): Used for displays and lighting.
Photodiodes: Used in solar cells and light sensors.
Thermistor
A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance changes significantly with temperature. There are two main types of thermistors:

NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors: Resistance decreases as the temperature increases.
PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) thermistors: Resistance increases as the temperature increases.
Thermistors are used in temperature sensing and control applications.",1048,5,"Semiconductors

,,,CHAPTER 8- INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT,"Chapter 8: Introduction to Management

Introduction
Management is the process of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling the resources of an organization in an efficient and effective manner to achieve the organizational goals. It is an essential function that exists in all types of organizations, including businesses, educational institutions, governments, and non-profits. Management helps organizations maximize their potential and ensures they operate smoothly.

Meaning of Management
The term “management” refers to the process through which individuals in an organization coordinate and direct the activities of others to achieve specific objectives. It involves setting goals, planning, organizing resources, leading teams, and controlling the processes to ensure the successful attainment of these goals.

Definition of Management
Several scholars and experts have defined management in different ways. Some key definitions are:

Harold Koontz: ""Management is the process of designing and maintaining an environment in which individuals, working together in groups, can efficiently accomplish selected aims.""

Peter Drucker: ""Management is a multi-purpose organ that manages a business and manages managers and manages workers and work.""

George R. Terry: ""Management is a distinct process consisting of planning, organizing, actuating, and controlling, performed to determine and accomplish the objectives by the use of people and resources.""

These definitions emphasize the critical elements of management: people, processes, and resources, all working in harmony to meet organizational goals.

Characteristics of Management
Management has several key characteristics that distinguish it from other functions or processes. These include:

Goal-Oriented: The primary purpose of management is to achieve organizational goals, whether it's profit maximization, growth, or other objectives.

Universal Applicability: Management is required in all types of organizations, regardless of the nature or size of the organization.

Continuous Process: Management is a continuous and ongoing process that involves planning, organizing, leading, and controlling at all times.

Dynamic Nature: Management practices must adapt to changing circumstances and evolving goals in the face of external and internal changes.

Multidimensional: It involves managing people, finances, materials, information, and other resources to ensure organizational success.

Integrative Force: Management brings together various functions and resources of an organization to work as a cohesive unit, facilitating the achievement of organizational goals.

Intangible: While the results of management can be measured (such as profits or growth), the process itself is not a physical entity, making it intangible.

Levels of Management
In an organization, management is typically divided into three primary levels. Each level has different responsibilities and scope of authority.

Top Management:

Definition: Top management refers to the highest level of management in an organization, such as the CEO, board of directors, and other senior executives.
Responsibilities: It is responsible for formulating overall organizational policies, strategic goals, and decision-making. Top management sets the vision, mission, and long-term goals of the organization.
Functions: Planning, decision-making, and directing the entire organization. They also represent the organization in front of external stakeholders.
Middle Management:

Definition: Middle management lies between the top management and lower management. It includes department heads, division managers, and branch managers.
Responsibilities: Middle management is responsible for implementing the policies and strategies formulated by the top management. They interpret top management's goals and convert them into specific operational plans.
Functions: Organizing, coordinating, and overseeing the execution of plans made by top management. Middle management also acts as a bridge between top and lower management, ensuring effective communication and resource allocation.
Lower or Supervisory (First Level) Management:

Definition: This level includes supervisors, foremen, and team leaders who are responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of employees.
Responsibilities: Lower management directly oversees the workforce and ensures that tasks are completed according to plan. They also provide guidance and support to workers, making sure work processes run smoothly.
Functions: Supervising, training, and evaluating workers. Lower management also handles the implementation of operational policies and ensures that performance meets expectations.
Management as an Art, Science, and Profession
Management can be seen from three perspectives: as an art, a science, and a profession.

Management as an Art:

Definition: Management is considered an art because it involves the application of personal skills, creativity, and intuition in solving problems and making decisions.
Explanation: Like any art form, management requires creativity, experience, and expertise to achieve effective results. It involves the ability to motivate people, handle crises, and apply judgment in decision-making.
Management as a Science:

Definition: Management is considered a science because it is based on systematic knowledge, research, and principles that can be tested and refined.
Explanation: Management has a solid foundation in theories, principles, and techniques that are tested and proven to work in various situations. Managers use scientific tools such as data analysis, forecasting, and quantitative methods to make informed decisions.
Management as a Profession:

Definition: Management is regarded as a profession because it requires specialized education, training, and a commitment to a set of ethical standards.
Explanation: Just like other professions, management requires individuals to possess specific skills and knowledge gained through education and experience. Managers are also expected to adhere to professional ethics and contribute to the betterment of society and the organization.",832,6,"Management

HSC,12.0,Chemistry,Solid State,"Solids
Solids have definite volume, shape, and mass due to the short distance between the fixed position of particles and the strong interactions between them.

1.1 Characteristic Properties of the Solid State
(i) They have definite mass, volume and shape.

(ii) Intermolecular distances are short.

(iii) Intermolecular forces are strong.

(iv) Their constituent particles (atoms, molecules or ions) have fixed positions and can only oscillate about their mean positions.

(v) They are incompressible and rigid.

1.2 Amorphous and Crystalline Solids
Solids can be classified as crystalline or amorphous on the basis of the nature of order present in the arrangement of their constituent particles. Amorphous solids behave like super cool liquids as the arrangement of constituent particles has short-range order, is isotropic in nature and has no sharp melting point. Crystalline solids have a characteristic shape, with the arrangement of constituent particles of long-range order, anisotropic in nature and a sharp melting point.

1.3 Classification of Crystalline Solids
The classification of crystalline solids is based on their property. The crystalline property depends on the nature of interactions between the constituent particles, and therefore these solids are divided into four different categories:
1. Ionic solids
2. Covalent or Network solids
3. Molecular solids
4. Metallic solids

1.4 Crystal Lattices and Unit Cells
Unit Cell - The smallest repeating unit of the crystal lattice is the unit cell, the building block of a crystal.
Types of Unit Cells:
A lattice can be generated by repeating a small portion called the unit cell. Below are some of the different varieties of the unit cell:
1. Primitive cubic unit cell
2. Body-centered cubic unit cll
3. Face-centred cubic unit cell
Crystal Lattices
A crystal structure is made of atoms. A crystal lattice is made of points. A crystal system is a set of axes. In other words, the structure is an ordered array of atoms, ions or molecules.
Characteristics of Crystal 
1. Each point in a lattice is called a lattice point or lattice site.
2. Each point in a crystal lattice represents one constituent particle which may be an atom, a molecule (a group of atoms) or an ion.
3. Lattice points are joined by straight lines to bring out the geometry of the lattice.

1.5 Number of Atoms in a Unit Cell
1.5.1 Primitive Cubic Unit Cell
The primitive cubic unit cell has atoms only at its corner. Each atom at a corner is shared between eight adjacent unit cells, four unit cells in the same layer, and four-unit cells in the upper or lower layer. Therefore, only 1/8th of an atom actually belongs to a particular unit cell.
1.5.2 Body-Centred Cubic Unit Cell
A body-centred cubic unit cell has an atom at each of its corners and also one atom at its body centre.
Thus, in a BCC cell, we have:
8 corners × 1/8 per corner atom = 8 × 1/8 = 1 atom
1 body center atom = 1 × 1 = 1 atom
Therefore, the total number of atoms present per unit cell = 2 atoms.
1.5.3 Face-Centred Cubic Unit Cell
A face-centred cubic unit cell contains atoms at all the corners and at the centre of all the faces of the cube. The atom present at the face center is shared between 2 adjacent unit cells, and only 1/2 of each atom belongs to an individual cell.
Number of atoms in BCC cell
a) 8 corners × 18 per corner atom = 8 × 18 = 1 atom
b) 6 face-centered atoms × 12 atom per unit cell = 3 atoms
Hence, the total number of atoms in a unit cell = 4 atoms
Thus, in a face-centred cubic unit cell, we have:
8 corners × 1/8 per corner atom = 8 × 1/8 = 1 atom
6 face-centered atoms × 1/2 atom per unit cell = 3 atoms
Therefore, the total number of atoms in a unit cell = 4 atoms.

1.6 Close-Packed Structures
In solids, the constituent particles are close-packed, leaving the minimum vacant space.
(a) Close Packing in One Dimension - In close packing of one dimension, spheres are arranged in a row such that adjacent atoms are in contact with each other. The coordination number is defined as the no. of nearest neighbour particles. In the case of one-dimension close packing, the coordination number is equal to two.
(b) Close Packing in Two Dimension - In two-dimensional close packing, a row of closed-packed spheres is stacked to obtain a two-dimensional pattern.
This stacking is done in two ways:
1. Square Close Packing and Hexagonal Close Packing
2. Packing in Solids: One and Two Dimensions
3.Hexagonal Close-Packing
(c) Close Packing in Three Dimensions - Crystalline solids exhibit a regular and repeating pattern of constituent particles. 
Three-dimensional closed packing are:
(i) Three-dimensional close packing forms two-dimensional square close-packed layers
(ii) Three-dimensional close packing from two-dimensional hexagonal close-packed layers.

1.6.1 Formula of a Compound and Number of Voids Filled
Voids literally mean gaps between constituent particles. Voids in solid states mean the vacant space between the constituent particles in a closed-packed structure. There are two types of interstitial voids in a 3D structure:
1. Tetrahedral voids and Octahedral voids
2. Tetrahedral and Octahedral void

1.7 Packing Efficiency - Packing Efficiency is the percentage of total space filled by the particles.
1.7.1 Packing Efficiency in hcp and ccp Structures - Hexagonal close packing (hcp) and cubic close packing (ccp) have the same packing efficiency.
1.7.2 Efficiency Packing in Body-Centred Cubic Structures - In a body-centred cubic unit cell, one atom is located at the body centre apart from the corners of the cube.
1.7.3 Packing Efficiency in Simple Cubic Lattice - In the simple cubic unit cell, atoms are located at the corners of the cube.

1.8 Calculations Involving Unit Cell Dimensions
The unit cell can be seen as a three-dimensional structure containing one or more atoms. We can determine the volume of this unit cell with the knowledge of the dimensions of the unit cell.
Mass of unit cell = number of atoms in unit cell × mass of each atom = z × m
Where, z = number of atoms in the unit cell, m = Mass of each atom
The mass of an atom can be given with the help of Avogadro number and molar mass as:
M/NA
Where M = molar mass
NA = Avogadro’s number
The volume of the unit cell, V = a3
=> Density of unit cell = mass of unit cell/ volume of the unit cell
=> Density of unit cell = m/V = z×ma/a3 = z×M/a3×NA

1.9 Imperfections in Solids
Point defects explain about the imperfections of solids along with the types of point defects. Point defects are accounted for when the crystallization process occurs at a very fast rate. These defects mainly happen due to deviation in the arrangement of constituting particles. The defects are of two types:
1. Point defects: Point defects are the irregularities or deviations from ideal arrangement around a point or an atom in a crystalline substance.
2. Line Defects: Line defects are irregularities or deviations from an ideal arrangement in entire rows of lattice points. These irregularities are called crystal defects.
1.9.1 Types of Point Defects
Point defects can be classified into three types:
1. Stoichiometric defect – In this kind of point defect, the ratio of positive and negative ions (Stoichiometric) and electrical neutrality of a solid is not disturbed. Sometimes it is also known as intrinsic or thermodynamic defects. Fundamentally, they are of two types: Vacancy defect and Interstitial defect
2. Frenkel defect – In ionic solids generally, the smaller ion (cation) moves out of its place and occupies an intermolecular space. In this case, a vacancy defect is created in its original position, and the interstitial defect is experienced at its new position.
3. Schottky defect – This kind of vacancy defects is found in Ionic Solids. But in ionic compounds, we need to balance the electrical neutrality of the compound so an equal number of anions and cations will be missing from the compound. It reduces the density of the substance. In this, the size of cations and anions is almost the same.

1.10 Electrical Properties
Solids can be classified into three types on the basis of their conductivities. They are:
(i) Conductors
(ii) Insulators
(iii) Semiconductors

1.11 Magnetic Properties
To study the magnetic properties of Magnetic Materials, the material is usually placed in a uniform magnetic field and then the magnetic field is varied. There are five major kinds of magnetic behaviour:
(i) Diamagnetic materials
(ii) Paramagnetic materials
(iii) Ferromagnetic materials
(iv) Antiferromagnetic materials
(v) Ferrimagnetic materials",,,,,
,,,Solutions and Colligative Properties,"Colligative Properties
A colligative property is a property of a solution that is dependent on the ratio between the total number of solute particles (in the solution) to the total number of solvent particles. Colligative properties are not dependent on the chemical nature of the solution’s components. Thus, colligative properties can be linked to several quantities that express the concentration of a solution, such as molarity, normality, and molality. The four colligative properties that can be exhibited by a solution are given below:
1. Boiling point elevation
2. Freezing point depression
3. Relative lowering of vapour pressure
4. Osmotic pressure
The word “colligative” has been adapted or taken from the Latin word “colligatus” which means “bound together”. In the context of defining a solution, colligative properties help us understand how the properties of the solution are linked to the concentration of solute in the solution.

What Are Colligative Properties?
A dilute solution containing non-volatile solute exhibits some properties which depend only on the number of solute particles present and not on the type of solute present. These properties are called colligative properties, and they are mostly seen in dilute solutions.
We can further consider colligative properties as those properties that are obtained by the dissolution of a non-volatile solute in a volatile solvent. Generally, the solvent properties are changed by the solute, where its particles remove some of the solvent molecules in the liquid phase. This also results in the reduction of the concentration of the solvent.
Besides, when we talk about the given solute-solvent mass ratio, colligative properties are said to be inversely proportional to the solute molar mass.

Colligative Properties Examples
We can observe the colligative properties of solutions by going through the following examples. If we add a pinch of salt to a glass full of water, its freezing temperature lowers considerably than the normal temperature. Alternatively, its boiling temperature will also increase, and the solution will have a lower vapour pressure. There will be changes in its osmotic pressure as well.
Similarly, if we add alcohol to water, the solution’s freezing point goes down below the normal temperature, and that is observed for either pure water or alcohol.

Different Types of Colligative Properties of Solution
There are different types of colligative properties of a solution, which include vapour pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression and osmotic pressure.
1. Lowering of Vapour Pressure
In a pure solvent, the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the solvent. If a non-volatile solute is added to the solvent, the surface now has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby fraction of the surface covered by solvent molecules gets reduced. Since the vapour pressure of the solution is solely due to the solvent alone, at the same temperature, the vapour pressure of the solution is found to be lower than that of the pure solvent.
If P0 is the vapour pressure of pure solvent and Ps is the vapour pressure of the solution, the difference Po – Ps is termed as the lowering in vapour pressure. The ratio, Po – Ps / Po, is known as the relative lowering of vapour pressure.
Raoult, in 1886, established a relation between relative lowering in vapour pressure and mole fraction. The relationship is known as Raoult’s law. It states that the relative lowering in vapour pressure of a dilute solution is equal to the mole fraction of the solute present in the solution.
If n moles of solute is dissolved in N moles of the solvent, then, according to Raoult’s law,
Po – Ps / Po = n / n + N
2. Elevation in Boiling Point
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. We know that with the addition of a non-volatile liquid to a pure solvent, the vapour pressure of a solution decrease. Therefore, to make vapour pressure equal to atmospheric pressure, we have to increase the temperature of the solution. The difference in the boiling point of the solution and the boiling point of the pure solvent is termed elevation in boiling point.

If T0b is the boiling point of the pure solvent and Tb is the boiling point of the solution, then elevation in boiling point is given as
∆Tb =T0b-Tb

Experimental results show that there is a relation between elevation in boiling point and molality ‘m’ of the solute present in the solution.
∆Tb ∝ m
∆Tb = kb m
Where,
kb = molal elevation constant
Substituting the value of ‘m’ in the above relation, we get
∆Tb = 1000 x kb x m2 / M2 x m1
Where,
m2 = mass of solvent in g
M1 = mass of solvent in kg
M2 = molar mass of solute

3. Depression in Freezing Point
The freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its vapour pressure in the solid phase. According to Raoult’s law, when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent, its vapour pressure decreases, and now it would become equal to that of a solid solvent at a lower temperature. The difference between the freezing point of the pure solvent and its solution is called depression in freezing point.
If T0f is the freezing point of the pure solvent and Tf is the freezing point when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it, then depression in the freezing point is given as
∆Tf =T0f -Tf
Just like elevation in boiling point, depression in freezing point is also directly related to molality ‘m’.
∆Tf = 1000 x kf x m2 / M2 x m1
Where,
k f = molal depression constant
m2 = mass of solvent in g
M1 = mass of solvent in kg
M2 = molar mass of solute

4. Osmotic Pressure
When a semipermeable membrane is placed between a solution and solvent, it is observed that solvent molecules enter the solution through the semipermeable membrane, and the volume of the solution increases. The semi-permeable membrane allows only solvent molecules to pass through it, but prevents the passage of bigger molecules like solute. This phenomenon of the spontaneous flow of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a pure solvent to a solution or from a dilute to a concentrated solution is called osmosis.
The flow of solvent molecules through the semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied from the solution side. This pressure that prevents the flow of solvent is called the osmotic pressure of the solution.
Osmotic pressure is a colligative property as it depends on the number of solutes present and not on the nature of the solute. Experimentally, it was proved that osmotic pressure (⫪) is directly proportional to molarity (C) and temperature (T).
Mathematically, ℼ = CRT, where R is the gas constant.
⇒ ℼ = (n2/V) RT
Here, V is the volume of solution in litres, and n2 is moles of solute
If m2 is the weight of solute and M2 molar mass of solute, then n2= m2/M2
ℼ = W2 RT / M2V
Thus, by knowing the values of ℼ,w2, T and V, we can calculate the molar mass of the solute.

Different Solutions
Isotonic solution: Two solutions having the same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are known as isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then there is no osmosis.
Hypotonic solution: A hypotonic solution has a lower osmotic pressure than that of the surrounding, i.e., the concentration of solute particles is less than that of the surrounding. If the hypotonic solution is separated by a semipermeable membrane, then water moves out of the hypotonic solution.
Hypertonic solution: A hypertonic solution has a higher osmotic pressure than that of the surrounding, i.e., the concentration of solute particles is more than that of the surrounding. If the hypertonic solution is separated by a semipermeable membrane, then water moves inside the hypertonic solution.
Different Solutions
To determine the molar mass, the osmotic pressure method has an advantage over other methods as pressure measurement is around room temperature. It is particularly useful for the determination of the molar mass of biomolecules as they are unstable at higher temperatures.
Van’t Hoff Factor
When the solute undergoes dissociation or association in solution, the number of particles in solution increases or decreases and thus, colligative properties change accordingly. The extent of dissociation or association of the solute in a solution can be expressed by a factor called Van’t Hoff.

Van’t Hoff Factor
i = observed colligative property/theoretical or normal colligative property 
=no. of particles after dissociation or association /no. of particles when there is no dissociation or association
= normal molecular mass of the solute/observed molecular mass of the solute",,,,,
,,,Chemical Thermodynamics and Energetic,"Thermodynamics deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms of energy. The four laws of thermodynamics govern the behaviour of these quantities and provide a quantitative description. William Thomson, in 1749, coined the term thermodynamics.
I. What is Thermodynamics?
Thermodynamics in physics is a branch that deals with heat, work and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation and physical properties of matter.
To be specific, it explains how thermal energy is converted to or from other forms of energy and how matter is affected by this process. Thermal energy is the energy that comes from heat. This heat is generated by the movement of tiny particles within an object, and the faster these particles move, the more heat is generated.
Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out. It is based on the initial and final states undergoing the change. It should also be noted that Thermodynamics is a macroscopic science. This means that it deals with the bulk system and does not deal with the molecular constitution of matter.

II. Distinction Between Mechanics and Thermodynamics
The distinction between mechanics and thermodynamics is worth noting. In mechanics, we solely concentrate on the motion of particles or bodies under the action of forces and torques. On the other hand, thermodynamics is not concerned with the motion of the system as a whole. It is only concerned with the internal macroscopic state of the body.

III.Different Branches of Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is classified into the following four branches:
1. Classical Thermodynamics
In classical thermodynamics, the behaviour of matter is analysed with a macroscopic approach. Units such as temperature and pressure are taken into consideration, which helps the individuals calculate other properties and predict the characteristics of the matter undergoing the process.
2. Statistical Thermodynamics
In statistical thermodynamics, every molecule is under the spotlight, i.e. the properties of every molecule and how they interact are taken into consideration to characterise the behaviour of a group of molecules.
3. Chemical Thermodynamics
Chemical thermodynamics is the study of how work and heat relate to each other in chemical reactions and in changes of states.
4. Equilibrium Thermodynamics
Equilibrium thermodynamics is the study of transformations of energy and matter as they approach the state of equilibrium.

IV. Basic Concepts of Thermodynamics – Thermodynamic Terms
Thermodynamics has its own unique vocabulary associated with it. A good understanding of the basic concepts forms a sound understanding of various topics discussed in thermodynamics preventing possible misunderstandings.
1. Thermodynamic System
A thermodynamic system is a specific portion of matter with a definite boundary on which our attention is focused. The system boundary may be real or imaginary, fixed or deformable.
There are three types of systems:
i. Isolated System – An isolated system cannot exchange energy and mass with its surroundings. The universe is considered an isolated system.
ii. Closed System – Across the boundary of the closed system, the transfer of energy takes place but the transfer of mass doesn’t take place. Refrigerator, compression of gas in the piston-cylinder assembly are examples of closed systems.
iii. Open System – In an open system, the mass and energy both may be transferred between the system and surroundings. A steam turbine is an example of an open system.
Surrounding
Everything outside the system that has a direct influence on the behaviour of the system is known as a surrounding.
2. Thermodynamic Process
A system undergoes a thermodynamic process when there is some energetic change within the system that is associated with changes in pressure, volume and internal energy.
There are four types of thermodynamic processes that have their unique properties, and they are:
Adiabatic Process – A process where no heat transfer into or out of the system occurs.
Isochoric Process – A process where no change in volume occurs and the system does no work.
Isobaric Process – A process in which no change in pressure occurs.
Isothermal Process – A process in which no change in temperature occurs.
A thermodynamic cycle is a process or a combination of processes conducted such that the initial and final states of the system are the same. A thermodynamic cycle is also known as cyclic operation or cyclic processes.
3. Thermodynamic Equilibrium
At a given state, all properties of a system have fixed values. Thus, if the value of even one property changes, the system’s state changes to a different one. In a system that is in equilibrium, no changes in the value of properties occur when it is isolated from its surroundings.

When the temperature is the same throughout the entire system, we consider the system to be in thermal equilibrium.
When there is no change in pressure at any point of the system, we consider the system to be in mechanical equilibrium.
When the chemical composition of a system does not vary with time, we consider the system to be in chemical equilibrium.
Phase equilibrium in a two-phase system is when the mass of each phase reaches an equilibrium level.
A thermodynamic system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium if it is in chemical equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium and thermal equilibrium and the relevant parameters cease to vary with time.

Thermodynamic Properties
Thermodynamic properties are defined as characteristic features of a system, capable of specifying the system’s state. Thermodynamic properties may be extensive or intensive.

Intensive properties are properties that do not depend on the quantity of matter. Pressure and temperature are intensive properties.
In the case of extensive properties, their values depends on the mass of the system. Volume, energy, and enthalpy are extensive properties.
What is Enthalpy?
Enthalpy is the measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system. The quantity of enthalpy equals the total heat content of a system, equivalent to the system’s internal energy plus the product of volume and pressure.

Mathematically, the enthalpy, H, equals the sum of the internal energy, E, and the product of the pressure, P, and volume, V, of the system.

H = E + PV

What is Entropy?
Entropy is a thermodynamic quantity whose value depends on the physical state or condition of a system. In other words, it is a thermodynamic function used to measure the randomness or disorder.

For example, the entropy of a solid, where the particles are not free to move, is less than the entropy of a gas, where the particles will fill the container.

Thermodynamic Potentials
Thermodynamic potentials are quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials measure the energy changes in a system as they evolve from the initial state to the final state. Different potentials are used based on the system constraints, such as temperature and pressure.

Different forms of thermodynamic potentials along with their formula are tabulated below:
Internal Energy	
Helmholtz free energy	F = U – TS
Enthalpy	H = U + PV
Gibbs Free Energy	G = U + PV – TS

Laws of Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics laws define the fundamental physical quantities like energy, temperature and entropy that characterize thermodynamic systems at thermal equilibrium. These thermodynamics laws represent how these quantities behave under various circumstances.

How many laws of thermodynamics are there?
There are four laws of thermodynamics and are given below:
Zeroth law of thermodynamics
First law of thermodynamics
Second law of thermodynamics
Third law of thermodynamics
In the next few sections, we will discuss each of the laws of thermodynamics in detail.

Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
The Zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two bodies are individually in equilibrium with a separate third body, then the first two bodies are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

This means that if system A is in thermal equilibrium with system C and system B is also in equilibrium with system C, then system A and B are also in thermal equilibrium.

An example demonstrating the Zeroth Law
Two cups measuring 100 °C are in equilibrium with each other

Consider two cups A and B, with boiling water. When a thermometer is placed in cup A, it gets warmed up by the water until it reads 100 °C. When it reads 100 °C, we say that the thermometer is in equilibrium with cup A. When we move the thermometer to cup B to read the temperature, it continues to read 100 °C. The thermometer is also in equilibrium with cup B. By keeping in mind the zeroth law of thermodynamics, we can conclude that cup A and cup B are in equilibrium with each other.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics enables us to use thermometers to compare the temperature of any two objects that we like.

First Law of Thermodynamics
First law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of conservation of energy, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be changed from one form to another.

The first law of thermodynamics may seem abstract, but we will get a clearer idea if we look at a few examples of the first law of thermodynamics.

First Law Of Thermodynamics Examples:
Plants convert the radiant energy of sunlight to chemical energy through photosynthesis. We eat plants and convert the chemical energy into kinetic energy while we swim, walk, breathe, and scroll through this page.
Switching on light may seem to produce energy, but it is electrical energy that is converted.

Second Law of Thermodynamics
Second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy in an isolated system always increases. Any isolated system spontaneously evolves towards thermal equilibrium—the state of maximum entropy of the system.

The entropy of the universe only increases and never decreases. Many individuals take this statement lightly and for granted, but it has an extensive impact and consequence.

Visualizing the second law of thermodynamics
If a room is not tidied or cleaned, it invariably becomes more messy and disorderly with time. When the room is cleaned, its entropy decreases, but the effort to clean it has resulted in increased entropy outside the room exceeding the entropy lost.

Third Law of Thermodynamics
Third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.

The entropy of a pure crystalline substance (perfect order) at absolute zero temperature is zero. This statement holds true if the perfect crystal has only one state with minimum energy.

Third Law Of Thermodynamics Examples:
Let us consider steam as an example to understand the third law of thermodynamics step by step:

The molecules within it move freely and have high entropy.
If one decreases the temperature below 100 °C, the steam gets converted to water, where the movement of molecules is restricted, decreasing the entropy of water.
When water is further cooled below 0 °C, it gets converted to solid ice. In this state, the movement of molecules is further restricted and the entropy of the system reduces more.
As the temperature of the ice further reduces, the movement of the molecules in them is restricted further and the entropy of the substance goes on decreasing.
When the ice is cooled to absolute zero, ideally, the entropy should be zero. But in reality, it is impossible to cool any substance to zero.

Thermodynamics Examples in Daily Life
Whether we are sitting in an air-conditioned room or travelling in any vehicle, the application of thermodynamics is everywhere. We have listed a few of these applications below:

Different types of vehicles such as planes, trucks and ships work on the basis of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
The three modes of heat transfer work on the basis of thermodynamics. The heat transfer concepts are widely used in radiators, heaters and coolers.
Thermodynamics is involved in the study of different types of power plants such as nuclear power plants, thermal power plants.
Thermodynamics – Summary and Overview
→ In simple terms, thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy from one form to another.

,,,Electrochemistry,"What Is Electrochemistry?
Electrochemistry is the subdiscipline of Chemistry that deals with the study of the relationship between electrical energy and chemical changes. Chemical reactions that involve the input or generation of electric currents are called electrochemical reactions. Such reactions are broadly classified into two categories:

Production of chemical change by electrical energy, i.e., the phenomenon of electrolysis
Conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy, i.e., the generation of electricity by spontaneous redox reactions.
Electricity can be produced when electrons move from one element to another in certain types of reactions (such as redox reactions). Typically, electrochemistry deals with the overall reactions when multiple redox reactions occur simultaneously, connected via some external electric current and a suitable electrolyte. In other words, electrochemistry is also concerned with chemical phenomena that involve charge separation (as seen commonly in liquids such as solutions). The dissociation of charge often involves charge transfer that occurs homogeneously or heterogeneously between different chemical species.

Electrochemical Cell
A spontaneous chemical process is one which can take place on its own, and in such a process, the Gibbs free energy of a system decreases. In electrochemistry, spontaneous reaction (redox reaction) results in the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. The reverse process is also possible where a non-spontaneous chemical reaction occurs by supplying electricity. These interconversions are carried out in equipment called an electrochemical cell.

Types of Electrochemical Cell
Electrochemical cells are of two types: galvanic cells and electrolytic cells

Galvanic Cell
The galvanic cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy, i.e., electricity can be obtained with the help of a redox reaction. The oxidation and reduction take place in two separate compartments. Each compartment consists of an electrolyte solution and a metallic conductor, which acts as an electrode. The compartment containing the electrode and the solution of the electrolyte is called half cells.

For example, the Daniell cell is a galvanic cell in which zinc and copper are used for a redox reaction to take place.

Zn(s) + Cu+2(aq) → Zn+2 + Cu(s)

At anode (oxidation half),

Zn(s) →Zn+2 + 2e–

At cathode( reduction half),

Cu+2(aq) + 2e– → Cu(s)

Galvanic Cell - Daniell cell

Salt bridge: The salt bridge is usually an inverted U-tube filled with a concentrated solution of inert electrolytes. It is used to maintain the charge balance and to complete the circuit by allowing the flow of ions through it. It contains a gel in which inert electrolytes like KNO3 or K2SO4 are mixed. Through the salt bridge, negative ion flows towards the anode and positive ion flows to the cathode, and the charge balance is maintained, and the cell keeps on functioning.

Electrode potential: In a galvanic cell, when two-electrode are dipped in their respective ion, there is a tendency for one of the electrodes (anode) to undergo oxidation, whereas the ion of the other electrode (cathode) has the tendency to gain an electron. This tendency of losing of electrons (oxidation) or gaining of electrons (reduction) is called electrode potential.

Standard electrode potential (E0): Standard electrode potential is defined as the electrode potential of an electrode relative to a standard hydrogen electrode under standard conditions. The standard conditions taken are as follows:

1 molar concentration of each ion in the solution.
A temperature of 298 K.
1 bar pressure.
Standard electrode potential 

Electrochemical Series

A series of the standard electrode has been established by measuring the potential of various electrodes versus standard hydrogen electrodes (SHE). When the electrodes (metals and non-metals) in contact with their ions are arranged on the basis of the values of their standard reduction potential or standard oxidation potentials, the resulting series is called the electrochemical series.

Elements reduction reaction

Elements Reduction Reactions

Cell potential or emf of a cell: In the galvanic cell, there are two half-cells, the oxidation half-cell (anode) and the reduction half-cell (cathode). Due to the difference in the potentials of these half-cells, the electric current moves from the electrode of higher potential (cathode) to the electrode of lower potential (anode). The difference between the electrode potential of the two half-cells is called cell potential or emf of a cell.

Eocell= ECathode– Eanode

ECathode= standard reduction potential of the cathode.

Eanode= standard reduction potential of the anode.

If Eocell is positive, then the reaction is feasible.

If Eocell is negative, then the reaction is not feasible.

Electrode and cell potentials – Nernst equation: The electrode potential and the emf of the cell depend upon the nature of the electrode, temperature and the activities (concentrations) of the ions in solution.

For the general electrochemical reaction of the type:

aA + bB → cC +dD

Ecell = Eocell – RT/ nF ln [C]c [D]d / [A]a [B]b

Ecell = Eocell – 2.0303 RT / nF log [C]c [D]d / [A]a [B]b

Ecell = Eocell – 0.0591 / n log [C]c [D]d / [A]a [B]b at 298K

Electrolytic Cell
The electrolytic cell converts electrical energy to chemical energy. Here, the electrodes are dipped in an electrolytic solution containing cations and anions. On supplying current, the ions move towards electrodes of opposite polarity, and simultaneous reduction and oxidation take place.

For example, in the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, sodium chloride is melted (above 801oC), two electrodes are inserted into the melt, and an electric current is passed through the molten salt. The chemical reaction that takes place at the electrodes is as follows:

● Sodium-ion migrates to the cathode, where sodium ion gains one electron and reduces to sodium metal.

Na+ + e–→ Na

● Chloride ions migrate towards the anode, where it loses one electron and gets oxidised to chlorine gas.

Cl–→1/2 Cl2 + e–

The overall reaction is the breakdown of sodium chloride into its elements

2NaCl→ 2Na(s) + Cl2(g)

Electrolysis of molten sodium chloride

Preferential discharge of ions: When there is more than one cation or anion, the process of discharge becomes competitive in nature. For example, in the electrolysis of NaCl solution, apart from Na+ and Cl–ions, the solution of sodium chloride also contains H+ and OH– ions due to the ionisation of water. When the potential difference is applied between the two electrodes, Na+ and H+ ions move towards the cathode and Cl– and OH– ions move towards the anode. At the cathode, H+ ions get reduced in preference to giving hydrogen gas because hydrogen has a higher reduction potential than sodium. Similarly, at the anode, Cl– ions are oxidised in preference to OH– to give chlorine gas.

Preferential discharge of ions

Faraday’s Law of Electrolysis
The relationship between the quantity of electric charge passed through an electrolyte, and the amount of substance deposited at the electrodes was given by Faraday in 1834, in the form of the law of electrolysis.

Faraday’s First Law

When an electric current is passed through an electrolyte, the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the quantity of electric charge passed through the electrolyte.

If W is the mass of the substance deposited by passing Q coulomb of charge, then according to this law:

W ∝ Q

Now, Q = I ✕ t

W ∝ I ✕ t

W = z ✕ I ✕ t

Where Z is a constant, known as electrochemical equivalent and is characteristic of a substance deposited.

Faraday’s constant (F) – It is the charge possessed by 1 mole of electrons, and it is equal to 96500 coulombs (approx.). In terms of Faraday’s constant, the number of gram equivalent of electrolyte discharged at an electrode is equal to Faraday’s passed,

W = E X Q / 96500

Faraday’s Second Law

When the same quantity of charge is passed through different electrolytes, then the mass of different substances deposited at the respective electrodes will be in the ratio of their equivalent masses.

Mathematically, it is represented as,

W1 / W2 = Z1 / Z2

Where, W1 and W2 are the weight of two substances which are deposited at their respective electrodes, and Z1 and Z2 are their respective equivalent weight.",,,,,
,,,Chemical Kinetics,"What is chemical kinetics?
The branch of chemistry which deals with the study of the reaction rates is known as Chemical Kinetics.

The word is derived from the Greek word ‘Kinesis‘ meaning movement. In fact, in all chemical reactions, the reacting species move and collide to form the products. Chemical kinetics also involves the investigation of reaction mechanisms, the conditions of concentration, temperature, pressure, and catalyst which control the rates of different reactions.

Classification of reactions on the basis of reaction rate
Different chemical reactions occur at different rates on the basis of rates, the chemical reactions are broadly divided into three categories.

Very fast or instantaneous reactions
Very slow reactions
Moderate reactions
(a) Very fast or instantaneous reactions:
These reactions are so fast that they occur as soon as the reactants are brought together.
These reactions involve ionic species.
These reactions take about 10-14 to 10-16 seconds to complete.
Examples

(i) Precipitation of AgCl when solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride are mixed.

AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3

(ii) Precipitation of BaSO4 when solutions of barium chloride and sulphuric acid are mixed.

BaCl₂ + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2HCl

(iii) Neutralisation of an acid with a base when their aqueous solutions are mixed.

HCI + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O

Note:

These reactions are extremely fast, it is therefore not possible to study their rates.
The spontaneous reactions may not be fast reactions.
(b) Very slow reactions
These reactions are extremely slow.
They may take months together to show any measurable change at room temperature.
Examples:

Fermentation of sugar in the presence of yeast takes more than a month.
Formation of coal and petroleum under earth’s crust.
The roasting of iron once started, may not be completed even after a year.
Note:

These reactions are not feasible to study the rates of reaction.
(c) Moderate reactions
These reactions proceed at a limited rate and their rates can be measured.
Examples

(i) Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide: 2H2O2 → 2H₂O + O2

(ii) Decomposition of nitrogen pentoxide: 2N₂O5 → 2N₂O4 + O₂

Factors affecting the reaction rate
The rates of chemical reactions are influenced by a number of factors. These are:

(i) Concentration of reactants:
The rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reacting species taking part in the reaction. It is maximum to start with and slowly decreases since the concentration of the reacting species decreases accordingly. In case of reversible reactions, the rate of chemical reaction can be studied separately for both the forward and backward reactions. In case of gaseous reactions, rate of reaction increases with increase in pressure.

(ii) Temperature
Rate of reaction increases with increase in temperature. The energy of the reactant species increases with the increase in temperature and so will the number of collisions. It has been observed that in most of the cases, about 10 degree increase in temperature makes the reaction rate double.

(iii) Presence of catalyst
In many chemical reactions, the reaction rate is enhanced by certain foreign substances called catalysts. They don’t consume in the reaction and also do not undergo any change in chemical characteristics.

The catalyst increases the rate of the reaction by providing a new reaction mechanism to occur within a lower activation energy.

(iv) Nature of reactants
The nature of reacting species may also influence the reaction rate. For example, combustion of nitric oxide (NO) is faster as compared to carbon monoxide(CO).

2NO (g) + O2 (g) → 2NO2 (Fast)

2CO (g) + O2 (g) → 2CO2 (Slow)

(iv) Surface area
An increase in surface area provided more opportunities for the reactants to come in contact or collide with each other resulting an increased reaction rate.

Example: we use granulated zinc metal in laboratory while preparing hydrogen gas on reacting with dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute sulphuric acid. Actually, granulated zinc has a greater surface area available for the attack by the acid than a lump of zinc. Therefore, it reacts at a faster rate.

(v) Exposure to radiation
The photochemical reactions are carried out in the presence of sunlight.
 
In these reactions, the photons of light are the source of energy which helps in breaking the bonds in the reacting molecules so that they can react and form product,",,,,,

,,,Coordination Compounds,"Many coordination compounds contain a metallic element as the central atom and are therefore referred to as metal complexes. These types of coordination complexes generally consist of a transition element as the central atom. It can be noted that the central atom in these complexes is called the coordination centre.

Important Terms Involving Coordination Compounds
The definitions of some important terms in the chemistry of coordination compounds can be found below.

Coordination Entity
A chemical compound in which the central ion or atom (or the coordination centre) is bound to a set number of atoms, molecules, or ions is called a coordination entity.

Some examples of such coordination entities include [CoCl3(NH3)3] and [Fe(CN)6]4-.

Central Atoms and Central Ions
As discussed earlier, the atoms and ions to which a set number of atoms, molecules, or ions are bound are referred to as the central atoms and the central ions.

In coordination compounds, the central atoms or ions are typically Lewis Acids and can, therefore, act as electron-pair acceptors.

Ligands
The atoms, molecules, or ions that are bound to the coordination centre or the central atom/ion are referred to as ligands.

These ligands can either be a simple ion or molecule, such as Cl– or NH3 or in the form of relatively large molecules, such as ethane-1,2-diamine (NH2-CH2-CH2-NH2).

Coordination Number
The coordination number of the central atom in the coordination compound refers to the total number of sigma bonds through which the ligands are bound to the coordination centre.

For example, in the coordination complex given by [Ni(NH3)4]2+, the coordination number of nickel is 4.

Coordination Sphere
The coordination sphere is the non-ionizable part of a complex compound, which consists of a central transition metal ion surrounded by neighbouring atoms or groups enclosed in a square bracket.

The coordination centre, the ligands attached to the coordination centre, and the net charge of the chemical compound as a whole form the coordination sphere when written together.

This coordination sphere is usually accompanied by a counter ion (the ionizable groups that attach to charged coordination complexes).

For example, [Co(NH3)6]C/3 – coordination sphere

Coordination Polyhedron
The geometric shape formed by the attachment of the ligands to the coordination centre is called the coordination polyhedron.

Examples of such spatial arrangements in coordination compounds include tetrahedral and square planar.

Oxidation Number
The oxidation number of the central atom can be calculated by finding the charge associated with it when all the electron pairs that are donated by the ligands are removed from it.

For example, the oxidation number of the platinum atom in the complex [PtCl6]2- is +4.

Homoleptic and Heteroleptic Complex
When the coordination centre is bound to only one type of electron pair donating ligand group, the coordination complex is called a homoleptic complex, for example, [Cu(CN)4]3-.
When the central atom is bound to many different types of ligands, the coordination compound in question is called a heteroleptic complex, for example, [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+.

Properties of Coordination Compounds
The general properties of coordination compounds are discussed in this subsection.

The coordination compounds formed by the transition elements are coloured due to the presence of unpaired electrons that absorb light in their electronic transitions. For example, the complexes containing Iron(II) can exhibit green and pale green colours, but the coordination compounds containing iron(III) have a brown or yellowish-brown colour.
When the coordination centre is a metal, the corresponding coordination complexes have a magnetic nature due to the presence of unpaired electrons.
Coordination compounds exhibit a variety of chemical reactivity. They can be a part of inner-sphere electron transfer reactions as well as outer-sphere electron transfers.
Complex compounds with certain ligands have the ability to aid in the transformation of molecules in a catalytic or stoichiometric manner.

Double Salts and Coordination Complex
Double Salts
Double salts are completely ionizable in aqueous solutions, and each ion in the solution gives the corresponding confirmatory test.

For example, potash alum is double sulphate. It is K2SO4.Al2(SO4)3.24H2O on ionization, and it gives K+, SO2−4 and Al+3 ions, which respond to the corresponding tests.

Coordination Complex
Coordinate complexes are incompletely ionizable in the aqueous solutions. They give a complexion which does not show complete ionization.

For example, potassium ferrocyanide. [K4Fe(CN)6]. It ionizes to give K+ and [Fe(CN)6]−4 [ferro cyanide ions].

Types of Coordination Complexes
Cationic complexes: In this coordination, the sphere is a cation. For example, [Co(NH3)6]Cl3
Anionic complexes: In this coordination, the sphere is Anion. For example, K4[Fe(CH)6]
Neutral Complexes: In this coordination, the sphere is neither a cation nor an anion. For example, [Ni(CO)4]
Homoleptic complex: The complex consists of a similar type of ligands. For example, K4[Fe(CN)6]
Heteroleptic complexes: These consist of different types of ligands. For example, [Co(NH3)5Cl]SO4
Mononuclear complexes: In this coordination, the sphere has a single transition metal ion. For example, K4[Fe(CN)6]
Polynuclear complexes: More than one transition metal ion is present. For example,

Polynuclear complexes


IUPAC Nomenclature of Coordination Compounds
Rules for Naming Coordination Compound
The standard rules that must be followed in the nomenclature of coordination compounds are explained below.

The ligands are always written before the central metal ion in the name of complex coordination complexes.
When the coordination centre is bound to more than one ligand, the names of the ligands are written in an alphabetical order which is not affected by the numerical prefixes that must be applied to the ligands.
When there are many monodentate ligands present in the coordination compound, the prefixes that give insight into the number of ligands are of the type: di-, tri-, tetra-, and so on.
When there are many polydentate ligands attached to the central metal ion, the prefixes are of the form bis-, tris-, and so on.
The names of the anions present in a coordination compound must end with the letter ‘o’, which generally replaces the letter ‘e’. Therefore, the sulfate anion must be written as ‘sulfato’, and the chloride anion must be written as ‘chlorido’.
The following neutral ligands are assigned specific names in coordination compounds: NH3 (ammine), H2O (aqua or aquo), CO (carbonyl), and NO (nitrosyl).
After the ligands are named, the name of the central metal atom is written. If the complex has an anionic charge associated with it, the suffix ‘-ate’ is applied.
When writing the name of the central metallic atom in an anionic complex, priority is given to the Latin name of the metal if it exists (with the exception of mercury).
The oxidation state of the central metal atom/ion must be specified with the help of Roman numerals that are enclosed in a set of parentheses.
If the coordination compound is accompanied by a counter ion, the cationic entity must be written before the anionic entity.

Examples of Naming Coordination Compounds
Some examples of the nomenclature of coordination compounds can be found below.

K4[Fe(CN)6]: Potassium hexa cyanide ferrate (II)
[Ni(CN)4]−2: Tetra cyano nickelate (II) ion.
[Zn(OH)4]−2: Tetra hydroxide zincate (II) ion.
[Ni(CO)4]: Tetra carbonyl Nickel (O).

What Are Ligands in Coordination Compounds?
The surrounding atoms, ions and molecules around the central transition metal ion are known as Ligands. They act as Lewis bases and donate electron pairs to transition metal ions; thus, a dative bond is formed between ligands and the transition metal ion. Hence, these compounds are coordination complexes.

Also Read: Ligands

Types of Ligands
Based on the nature of the bond between the ligand and the central atom, ligands are classified as follows:

Anionic ligands: CN–, Br–, Cl–
Cationic ligands: NO+
Neutral ligands: CO, H2O, NH3
Ligands can be further classified as:

Unidentate Ligands
The ligands which only have one atom that can bind to the coordination centre are called unidentate ligands. Ammonia (NH3) is a great example of a unidentate ligand. Some common unidentate are Cl–, H2O etc.

Bidentate Ligands
Ligands which have the ability to bind to the central atom via two separate donor atoms, such as ethane-1,2-diamine, are referred to as bidentate ligands.

Oxalate ion is a bidentate, as it can bond through two atoms to the central atom in a coordination compound and Ethane-1, 2-diamine:

Polydentate Ligands

Polydentate Ligands
Some ligands have many donor atoms that can bind to the coordination centre. These ligands are often referred to as polydentate ligands.

A great example of a polydentate ligand is the EDTA4- ion (ethylene diamine tetraacetate ion), which can bind to the coordination centre via its four oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms.

Chelate Ligand
When a polydentate ligand attaches itself to the same central metal atom through two or more donor atoms, it is known as a chelate ligand. The atoms that ligate to the metal ion are termed as the denticity of such ligands.

Ambidentate Ligand
Some ligands have the ability to bind to the central atom via the atoms of two different elements.

For example, the SCN– ion can bind to a ligand via the nitrogen atom or via the sulfur atom. Such ligands are known as ambidentate ligands.

Isomerism in Coordination Compounds
Two or more compounds that have the same chemical formula but a different arrangement of atoms are known as isomers. Due to this difference in the arrangement of atoms, coordination compounds pre-dominantly exhibit two types of isomerism, namely, stereo-isomerism and structural isomerism.

Stereoisomerism
Coordination compounds which have the same chemical and chemical bonds but have different spatial arrangements are known as stereoisomers. These are further divided into optical isomerism and geometrical isomerism.

Optical Isomerism in Coordination Compounds
The isomer which forms a non-superimposable mirror image is known as optical isomers or enantiomers, and they are of two types:

The isomer that rotates plane-polarized light towards a clockwise direction is the dextro or ‘d’ or ‘+’ isomer.
The isomer that rotates plane-polarized light towards an anti-clockwise direction is the leavo isomer or ‘l’, ‘-‘ isomer.
The equimolar mixture of ‘d’ and ‘l’ isomers is known as the racemic mixture.

Example of Optical Isomerism:

Optical Isomerism

Geometrical Isomerism
Geometrical isomerism is observed in heteroleptic complexes (complexes with more than one type of ligand) due to different possible geometric arrangements of the ligands.

This behaviour is mainly observed in coordination compounds having coordination numbers equal to 4 and 6. Geometrical isomerism of complexes with coordination number 4:

ML4 tetrahedral complexes do not show cis-trans isomerism since ligands are in different directions.
MABCD has 3 geometrical isomers. 2-cis and 1-trans.
MA2B2 complex shows cis and trans isomers.
For example,

Geometrical Isomerism 01

ML6 octahedral complex does not show geometrical isomerism. MA2B4 complex shows cis-trans isomerism.

For example, [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+

Geometrical isomerism 02

MA3B3 complex shows facial-meridional isomerism.


49,295
Structural Isomerism
Structural isomerism is exhibited by the coordination compounds, having the same chemical formula but a different arrangement of atoms. They are further divided into four types:

Linkage Isomerism
Linkage isomerism is exhibited by coordination compounds having Ambidentate ligands.

For example, [Co(NH3)5No]So4 and [Co(NH3)5ONO]So4

Coordination Isomerism
In coordination isomerism, the interchange of ligands between cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in coordination compounds takes place.

For example, [Co(NH3)6][Cr(CN)6] and [Cr(NH3)6][Co(CN)6].

Ionisation Isomerism
Ionisation isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt which is a potential ligand, replaces the ligand.

For example, [Co(NH3)5(SO4)]Br and [Co(NH3)5Br]SO4.

Solvate Isomerism
Solvate isomers are a special case of ionisation isomerism in which compounds differ depending on the number of the solvent molecule directly bonded to the metal ion.

For example,

[Co(H2O)6]Cl3
[Co(H2O)5Cl]Cl2.H2O
[Co(H2O)4Cl2]Cl.2H2O
[Co(H2O)3Cl3].3H2O
Ligand Isomerism
In this type, ligands show isomerism.

For example,

Ligand Isomerism

Werner’s Theory
Alfred Werner, in 1898, proposed Werner’s theory, explaining the structure of coordination compounds.

Werner’s Experiment: By mixing AgNO3 (silver nitrate) with CoCl3·6NH3, all three chloride ions got converted to AgCl (silver chloride). However, when AgNO3 was mixed with CoCl3·5NH3, two moles of AgCl were formed.

Further, on mixing CoCl3·4NH3 with AgNO3, one mole of AgCL was formed. Based on this observation, the following Werner’s theory was postulated:

Postulates of Werner’s Theory
The central metal atom in the coordination compound exhibits two types of valency, namely, primary and secondary linkages or valencies.
Primary linkages are ionizable and are satisfied by the negative ions.
Secondary linkages are non-ionizable. These are satisfied by negative ions. Also, the secondary valence is fixed for any metal and is equal to its coordination number.
The ions bounded by the secondary linkages to the metal exhibit characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different coordination numbers.
Difference between Primary and Secondary Valency in Coordination Compounds
Werner’s Theory
Primary Valency	Secondary Valency
These are ionizable	These are non-ionizable
Satisfied by charged ions	Satisfied by ligands
Primary valency does not help in the structure of complex	Secondary valency helps in the structure of complex
It can also function as a secondary valence	It can not function as a primary valency
For example,

 
is Werner complex.
Werner's Theory

Such spatial arrangement is termed coordination polyhedra. The terms inside the square brackets are coordination complexes, and the ions outside the square brackets are counter-ions.

Limitations of Werner’s Theory
It fails to explain the magnetic, colour and optical properties shown by coordination compounds.
It failed to explain the reason why all elements don’t form coordination compounds.
It failed to explain the directional properties of bonds in coordination compounds.
This theory does not explain the stability of the complex.
This theory could not explain the nature of complexes.
Effective Atomic Number Rule
Effective Atomic Number Rule is proposed by Sidgwick. The total number of electrons passed by the central transition metal ion after the donation of electrons by the ligand is an effective atomic number.

A complex is stable if the effective atomic number is equal to the atomic number of the nearest inert gas.

For example, calculate the effective atomic number of the following complexes:

K4[Fe(CN)6]
[Co(NH3)]Cl3
1. K4[Fe(CN)6]

Number of electrons in Fe2+ = 24

Number of electrons by Six CN = 2×6 = 12

Total number of electrons possessed by Fe2+ = 24 + 12

Therefore, the effective atomic number = 36.

2. [Co(NH3)]Cl3

Number of electrons in Co+3 = 24

Number of electrons by six NH3 = 2×6 = 12

Total number of electrons possessed by Co+3 = 24 + 12

Therefore, the effective atomic number = 36.

Magnetic Properties of Complexes
The complex in which a central transition metal ion has unpaired electrons is paramagnetic.
The complex in which a central transition metal ion has no unpaired electrons is diamagnetic.
The magnetic moment of a complex is calculated by the spin only formula.
M = √[n(n+2)] BM

BM = Bohr Magneton

The magnetic moment of complex compounds depends upon the following:

Type of hybridization.
The oxidation state of central transition metal ion.
The number of unpaired electrons.
Spectro Chemical Series
The series of increasing order of field strength of ligands are known as the spectrochemical series. It is I– < Br– < SCN– < Cl– < S-2 < F– < OH– < C2O-24 < H2O < NCS− < (EDTA)-4 < NH3 < en < CN < CO

Stability of Complexes
A complex is formed in several steps. Each process step is reversible, and the equilibrium constant is known as the stepwise formation constant. Let us consider the formation of complex ML4:

Stability of Complex

The overall formation constant or stability constant, β = K1 × K2 × K3 × K4 and 1/β = Instability constant

Factors Affecting the Stability of Complexes
Small size and high nuclear charge of central transition metal ion
Crystal field stabilizing energy (CFSE) should be more
Complexes containing chelating ligands are more stable
Octahedral complexes are generally more stable than tetrahedral
Also, Check ⇒ Crystal Field Theory

Colour of Complexes
Complexes in which central transition metal ion contains unpaired electrons show colour. It is ‘d – d’ transition. The colour of complexes depends upon the following:

Number of unpaired electrons in transition metal ion
Nature of ligands
The oxidation state of central transition metal ion
The wavelength of light absorbed and emitted
The proportion of ligands in the coordination sphere
Example: [Ni(H2O)6]+2+en(aq)→[Ni(H2O)4en]+2 – Green Pale blue

Bonding in Metal Complexes [Metal Carbonyls]
Complexes in which carbon monoxide acts as ligands are metal carbonyls.

For example,  [Ni(CO)4] Tetracarbonyl Nickel (0) and [Fe(CO)5] Penta Carbonyl Iron (0). In these complexes, complexes a′σ‘ bond is formed by the overlapping of vacant ‘d’ orbital of metal ion and filled orbital of C-atom (carbon).

A π bond is formed by the lateral overlapping of filled inner orbitals of metal ion and vacant of the carbon atom. Thus, synergic bonding exists in metal carbonyls.

Applications of Coordination Compounds
The characteristic properties possessed by coordination compounds that were discussed in the previous subsection make them extremely useful in various processes and industries. Some of the applications of coordination compounds are given below.

The colour of the coordination compounds containing transition metals causes them to be extensively used in industries for the colouration of materials. They find applications in the dye and pigment industries.
Some complex compounds containing cyanide as a ligand are used in the process of electroplating. These compounds are also very useful in photography.
Coordination complexes are very useful in the extraction of many metals from their ores. For example, nickel and cobalt can be extracted from their ores via hydro-metallurgical processes involving ions of coordination compounds.

,,,Halogen Derivatives of Alkanes and Arenes,"What are Haloalkanes and Haloarenes?
Haloalkanes and haloarenes are the hydrocarbons in which one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with halogen atoms. The primary difference between haloalkanes and haloarenes is that haloalkanes are derived from open-chain hydrocarbons (alkanes) whereas haloarenes are derived from aromatic hydrocarbons.

Haloalkanes are commonly referred to as alkyl halides whereas haloarenes are commonly referred to as aryl halides. These compounds can contain multiple halogen atoms, as illustrated below.

Haloalkanes and Haloarenes 

Generally, In haloalkanes, the halogen atoms are attached to sp3 hybridized carbon atoms whereas in haloarenes, the point of attachment is sp2 hybridized carbon atom. The difference in the hybridization state of the carbon atom in C-X bond is responsible for the different characteristics which the two families have. The presence of halogens makes haloalkanes and haloarenes more chemically reactive than the parent alkanes and aromatic compounds. These compounds have many medicinal uses as well.

Classification of Haloalkanes and Haloarenes
Alkyl halides and aryl halides can be classified based on the following parameters:

Number of halogen atoms in the molecule
sp3 hybridized carbon-halogen bond.
sp2 hybridized carbon-halogen bond.
The classification of haloalkanes and haloarenes is described in the tabular column provided below.

Classification based on the number of halogen atoms.	Monohaloalkanes and Monohaloarenes	Contain 1 halogen atom
Dihaloalkanes and Dihaloarenes	2 halogen atoms are attached
Trihaloalkanes and Trihaloarenes	Contain 3 halogen atoms
Haloalkanes and haloarenes in which the halogen is attached to an sp3 hybridized carbon.	Alkyl Halide	Halogen is attached to an alkyl chain.
Allylic Halide	The halogen atom is attached to an sp3 hybridized carbon which is adjacent to C=C (double bond or sp2 hybridized carbon)
Benzylic Halide	The halogen is attached to an sp3 hybridized carbon which is attached to a benzene ring.
Compounds in which the halogen is attached to a sp2 hybridized carbon	Vinyl Halide	The halogen atom is attached to C=C (sp2 hybridized carbon).
Aryl Halide	The halogen is attached to a sp2 hybridized carbon which belongs to an aromatic ring.
Thus, the different ways in which haloalkanes and haloarenes are classified are discussed with the help of a tabular column. Click here to learn about the nomenclature of haloalkanes as per IUPAC guidelines.

Some important applications of these compounds are listed below.

These organic compounds can dissolve non-polar compounds and are therefore used as solvents.
Many derivatives of alkyl and aryl halides are used in medicine. One such example is the compound chloramphenicol, which is used to treat cases of typhoid.
Another example is chloroquine, which is very useful in the treatment of malaria.
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (commonly referred to as DDT) is used as an insecticide.
Some haloalkanes and haloarenes have adverse effects on the environment and are labelled as pollutants. One such example is chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs), which lead to the depletion of the ozone layer which protects the Earth from the harmful radiation coming from the sun.

,,,"Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids","What are Aldehydes, Ketones, and Carboxylic Acids?
Aldehydes, Ketones, and Carboxylic Acids are carbonyl compounds which contain a carbon-oxygen double bond. These organic compounds are very important in the field of organic chemistry and also have many industrial applications.

The presence of the common carbonyl group in the two classes of compounds makes them display similar chemical properties. However, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones because of the presence of free hydrogen atom.

Organic compounds containing a carbon-oxygen double bond called the carboxyl group, which is one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry. Carbonyl group is one of the important groups present in compounds in a living system.

What are Aldehydes?
Aldehydes are organic compounds which have the functional group -CHO.

These carbonyl compounds consist of a central carbonyl carbon doubly bonded to an oxygen and single bonded to the R group (any alkyl group) and a hydrogen atom.

Aldehyde

Where R stands for alkyl or aryl group.

Preparation of Aldehydes
Acid chlorides are reduced to aldehydes with hydrogen in the presence of palladium catalyst spread on barium sulfate.

Preparation of Aldehydes

This reaction is known as Rosenmund reduction and is mostly used for the preparation of aromatic aldehydes. This reaction cannot be used for the preparation of ketones and formaldehyde.

Properties of Aldehydes
The structure of aldehydes shows a sp2 hybridized central carbon which is doubly connected to oxygen and has a single bond with hydrogen.
Small aldehydes are quite soluble in water.
Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are great examples of this. These two aldehydes are quite important industrially.
Aldehydes generally exhibit a tendency to undergo oligomerization or polymerization.
The carbonyl centre of the aldehyde has an electron-withdrawing nature. Therefore, the aldehyde group can be considered somewhat polar.

Nomenclature of Aldehydes
Acyclic and Aliphatic Aldehydes are named after their longest carbon chain along with the “-al” suffix. For example, CH3CH3CH2CHO is called butanal since it has four carbons in the chain.
When the aldehyde functional group is added to a ring, the “-carbaldehyde” suffix must be used. For example, C6H11CHO is called cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
In the case of natural compounds or carboxylic acids, “-oxo” is used as a prefix to highlight the carbon which is a part of the aldehyde functional group. For example, (CHO)-CH2COOH is called 3-oxopropanoic acid.
Some common and IUPAC names for some aldehydes are tabulated below.

Formula	Common name	IUPAC name
HCHO	Formaldehyde	Methanal
CH3CHO	Acetaldehyde	Ethanal
CH3-CH(CH3)-CHO	Isobutyraldehyde	2-Methylpropanal
CH3-CH=CH-CHO	Crotonaldehyde	2-Butenal

Uses of Aldehydes
Formaldehyde is used as a disinfectant and as a preservative for biological specimens.
Aldehyde is used for silvering mirrors.
Formaldehyde is used for the production of a variety of plastic and resins.
Benzaldehyde is used in perfumery and in the dye industry.

What are Ketones?
Ketones are organic compounds which have the functional group C=O and the structure R-(C=O)-R’.

These carbonyl compounds have carbon-containing substituents on both sides of the carbon-oxygen double bond. The carbonyl carbon of the ketone group is sp2 hybridized. The structure of ketones is a trigonal planar centred around the carbonyl carbon. The bond angles of this structure approximate at 1200. Since the carbon-oxygen bond makes the carbonyl group polar (oxygen is more electron-withdrawing than carbon), ketones tend to be nucleophilic at the oxygen atom and electrophilic at the carbon atom.

Ketone

Ketones are mass-produced industrially for their use as solvents, pharmaceuticals, and as precursors for polymers. Important ketones include methyl ethyl ketone (also called butanone), cyclohexanone, and acetone.

Preparation of Ketones
Acid chlorides on reaction with dialkyl cadmium produce ketones. Dialkyl cadmium themselves are prepared from Grignard reagents.

2R-Mg-X + CdCl2 → R2Cd + 2 Mg(X)Cl
2RCOCl + R2Cd → 2R-CO-R + CdCl2

The method is useful in a way that the mixed ketones can be prepared very conveniently.

Properties of Ketones
Ketones are polar in nature due to the presence of a polar carbonyl group. Therefore they have higher boiling points than non-polar compounds.
It cannot form any intermolecular hydrogen bond-like alcohols because there is no hydrogen attached to an oxygen atom.
Ketones have large dipole moments compared to alcohols or ethers due to the shifting of pi electrons.
Ketones react with hydrogen cyanide to form cyanohydrins. The reaction is normally carried out in the presence of a base, which acts as a catalyst in the absence of a base the reaction proceeds slowly.
Most of the ketones form bisulphite addition products when it is added to sodium bisulphite.

Nomenclature of Ketones
Ketones are named after their parent alkanes with the suffix “-anone”. The carbonyl group’s position in the ketone is denoted by a number while naming the ketone. For example, CH3(CO)CH3 is called 2 propanone. However, this compound is generally referred to as acetone.
Commonly, ketones are named by writing the name of each individual alkyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon and then “ketone” as the third word of the name. For example, butanone can be written as methyl ethyl ketone.
Formula	Common name	IUPAC name
CH3-C(O)-CH3	Acetone	Propanone
CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3	Ethylmethylketone	Butanone
CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3	Diethyl ketone	Pentan-3-one
CH3-CH(CH3)-C(O)-CH3	Isopropyl methyl ketone	3-Methylbutan-2-one

Uses of Ketones
Propanone is used to make polymers for example perspex.
ketones are used as solvents and as a starting material for the synthesis of many organic compounds.
Acetone and ethyl methyl ketone is mainly used as industrial solvents.

What is Carboxylic Acid?
Carboxylic acids are organic compounds that contain a (C=O)OH group attached to an R group (where R refers to the remaining part of the molecule).

The COOH group is commonly referred to as a carboxyl group. Carboxylic acids can generally be expressed via the formula R-COOH. Carboxylic acids have a polar nature. They can also participate in hydrogen bonding owing to their hydrogen bond accepting nature of the C=O group and the hydrogen bond donating nature of the O-H bond. They generally have higher boiling points when compared to water and tend to form stable dimers.

Carboxylic acids play an important role in the production of pharmaceuticals, food additives, solvents, and polymers. Acetic acid, adipic acid, and citric acid are a few carboxylic acids which are extremely useful industrially.

Preparation of Carboxylic Acids
Primary alcohols are readily oxidized to carboxylic acids with common oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate in neutral acidic or alkaline media or by potassium dichromate and chromium trioxide in acidic media.

RCH2OH → RCOOH

CH3(CH2)8CH2OH → CH3(CH2)8COOH

Properties of Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids are polar compounds and can extensively enter into hydrogen bonding.
Aromatic carboxylic acids are practically insoluble in cold water. All carboxylic acids are soluble in organic solvents like ether, alcohol, benzene, etc.
Among organic acids, carboxylic acids are the most acidic, but they are less acidic than the mineral acids, namely nitric acid and sulphuric acid.

Nomenclature of Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids are named by adding an “-oic acid” suffix to their parent chain. For example, C3H7COOH is called butanoic acid.
Even if there are other substituents present, the carboxylic acid can be considered at the first position of the parent chain, as seen in the name for 3-Chloropropanoic acid.
The COOH group can also be called “carboxy” and used as a substituent in the name of the parent structure. For example, 2-Furoic acid is commonly referred to as 2-carboxy furan.
Formula	Common name	IUPAC name
HCOOH	Formic acid	Ethanoic acid
CH3COOH	Acetic acid	Ethanoic acid
CH3CH2COOH	Propionic acid	Propanoic acid
C6H5COOH	Benzoic acid	Benzenecarboxylic acid


Frequently Asked Questions – FAQs
Q1
Do carboxylic acids react with aldehydes?
The carbonyl groups in aldehydes and ketones can be oxidized to form the next “oxidation level” compound-carboxylic acid. Adding water to an aldehyde or ketone produces a product called a hydrate or gemdiol (two OH groups on one carbon). The reaction is catalyzed by acids and bases.

Q2
Are ketones and aldehydes carboxylic acid derivatives?
The difference between carboxylic acid derivatives and aldehydes and ketones is that there is a group containing a negatively charged heteroatom (usually oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur), which is directly connected to the carbonyl carbon atom. You can think of carboxylic acid derivatives as bilateral.

Q3
Which is more acidic aldehyde or ketone?
Compared with the alkyl groups of ketones, aldehydes are more acidic (lower pKa) than ketones due to the lower electron donating effect of protons.

Q4
What does Schiff’s test for?
The Schiff test is a chemical test used to check the presence of aldehydes in a specific analyte by reacting the analyte with a small amount of Schiff reagent.

Q5
How do you purify aldehydes?
The solid aldehyde can be dissolved in ether and purified as described above. Alternatively, they can be steam distilled, then sublimated and crystallized from toluene or petroleum ether.

To conclude – Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic acids are very important carbonyl compounds industrially as well as in the laboratory. Their nomenclature can be done by following IUPAC guidelines or by following common practices.

What are Aldehydes and ketones?
Aldehydes and ketones incorporate a carbonyl functional group, C=O. These are organic compounds with structures -CHO and RC(=O)R’, where R and R’ represent carbon-containing substituents respectively.

What are Aldehydes? 
In aldehydes, the carbonyl group has one hydrogen atom attached to it together with either a 2nd hydrogen atom or a hydrogen group which may be an alkyl group or one containing a benzene ring.

Example:

Examples of Aldehydes

One can notice that all these have the exact same end to the molecule. The only difference is the complexity of the other attached group.


What are Ketones?
In ketones, the carbonyl group has 2 hydrocarbon groups attached to it. These can be either the ones containing benzene rings or alkyl groups. Ketone does not have a hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl group.

Example:

Examples of Ketones

Propane is generally written as CH3COCH3.  In pentanone, the carbonyl group could be in the middle of the chain or next to the end – giving either pentan-3-one or pentan-2-one.

Molisch, Schiffs, Iodoform reacts similar with aldehydes and ketones. But Tollen’s reagents gives silver mirror only to aldehyde not to ketone.



Frequently Asked Questions
Q1
How are Aldehydes and Ketones Different?
The carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde has a hydrogen atom attached to it whereas that of a ketone is attached to two alkyl or aryl groups. The C-H bond in aldehydes makes them easily oxidizable (they are strong reducing agents).

Q2
Why are Aldehydes more Reactive towards Nucleophilic Substitutions than Ketones?
The two alkyl/aryl groups in ketones offer steric hindrance during substitution reactions. Since the hydrogen atom is relatively small, it barely offers any steric hindrance. This is the primary reason why aldehydes are more susceptible to nucleophilic substitutions. Also, the partially positive charge on the carbonyl carbon is stabilized by the two R groups in ketones.

Q3
Why are the Boiling Points of Ketones Higher than those of Aldehydes?
The presence of two electron-donating R-groups in ketones makes them more polar than aldehydes. The dipole moments that arise from this polarity account for the higher boiling points of ketones.

Q4
What are the uses of Ketones?
Ketones are used as excellent solvent in industry, acetone is used as a nail paint remover and paint thinner. They are also used in medicine , textiles, varnishes, plastics, paint remover, paraffin wax etc.

,,,Compounds Containing Nitrogen,"Introduction to Amines – Compounds Containing Nitrogen
Amines are one of the most important classes of organic compounds which can be derived when we replace one or more hydrogen atoms of ammonia molecule with an alkyl group.

What are Amines?
An amine is generally a functional group with a nitrogen atom having a lone pair. Amines resemble ammonia structurally where nitrogen can bond up to 3 hydrogen atoms. It is also characterized by various properties that are based on carbon connectivity.

Compounds of nitrogen connected to a carbonyl group are called as amides, they have a structure R–CO–NR′R″ and vary in properties with amines.

Amines

Amines are organic compounds that contain nitrogen atoms with a lone pair. Basically, they are derived from ammonia (NH3) in which one or more hydrogen atoms is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group, and so they are known as alkylamines and arylamines respectively.

Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons and so is trivalent with a lone pair. As per VSEPR theory, nitrogen present in amines is sp3 hybridized and due to the presence of lone a pair, it is pyramidal instead of tetrahedral shape which is a general structure for most sp3 hybridized molecules. Each of the three sp3 hybridized orbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or carbon depending upon the configuration of amines. Due to the presence of a lone pair, the C-N-H angle in amines is less than 109 degrees which is a characteristic angle of tetrahedral geometry. The angle of amines is near about 107 degrees.

Amines Occurrence of Amines
Naturally, amines occur in proteins, vitamins, hormones, etc. and they are also prepared synthetically to make polymers, drugs, and dyes.


Types of Amines
On the basis of how the hydrogen atoms are replaced by an ammonia molecule, amines can be divided into 4 types.

Types of Amines

Primary AminesWhen one of the hydrogen atoms of the ammonia molecule is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group.Eg: Methylamine CH3NH2, Aniline C6H5NH2
Secondary AminesTwo organic substituents replace the hydrogen atoms of the ammonia molecule forming an amine.Eg: Dimethylamine (CH3)2NH, Diphenylamine  (C6H5)2NH
Tertiary AminesWhen all 3 of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by an organic substituent, it could be an aryl or aromatic group.Eg: Trimethylamine N(CH3)3, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
Cyclic AminesThese are secondary or tertiary amines in an aromatic ring structure. Eg: Piperidine (CH2)5NH, Aziridines C2H5N

Preparation of Amines
Some processes for preparing primary amines are mentioned below.

Preparation of Primary Amines
1. Making of amines from halogenoalkanes
This process will be carried out in a sealed tube. Here haloalkanes will be heated with the concentrated solution of ammonia in ethanol. The mixture cannot be heated under the reflux as ammonia would move out in the form of gas from a container.

Amines
Now coming to the preparation of primary amine from halogenoalkane, the reaction takes place in two stages. Salt will be formed at the first stage. Here ethyl ammonium bromide is the salt. It is similar to ammonium bromide except for the fact that one of the hydrogens in the ammonium atom is replaced by an ethyl group.
Amines
A reverse reaction can occur between ammonia and the salt. It is illustrated in the above reaction.
2. Reduction of nitriles
We can get primary amines when nitriles are reduced with lithium aluminium hydride. This method is mainly used for the preparation of amines which contain one carbon atom more than the starting amine.

Reduction of nitriles
3. Gabriel phthalimide synthesis
We can get primary amines easily by Gabriel synthesis. In this process, on the treatment of phthalimide with ethanolic potassium hydroxide, we get potassium salts of phthalimide. When this is further heated with alkyl halide followed by alkaline hydrolysis then primary amine is produced. We cannot prepare aromatic primary amines because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion which is formed by phthalimide.

Gabriel phthalimide synthesis
Basicity of Amines
Similar to ammonia, primary & secondary amines have protic hydrogens and thus they showcase a degree of acidity. Whereas tertiary amines have no protic hydrogen and thus do not possess a degree of acidity.

pKa value for primary & secondary amines is about 38, which makes them a real weak acid. Whereas if we take the pKb, it is about 4. This makes the amines much more basic than acidic. Thus, an aqueous solution of an amine is strongly alkaline.


Uses of Amines
Amines have a widespread application in our daily lives. Some uses of amines are listed below:

It is used in water purification, medicine manufacturing and development of insecticides and pesticides.
It is involved in the production of amino acids which is the building block of proteins in living beings. Many varieties of vitamins are also made by amines.
Serotonin is an important amine that functions as one of the primary neurotransmitters. It controls the feelings of hunger and is critical for the speed with which the brain operates in general.
Pain-relieving medicines such as Morphine and Demerol which are also known as analgesics are made from amines.

Frequently Asked Questions – FAQS
Q1
What is the order of basicity of Amines?
Ans: Due to the presence of lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of amine, it has the ability to donate a pair of electrons to form a base. The basicity of amines depends upon following factors, stectric factors, Electronic factor and solvent factor,
In the gaseous state, the order of basicity of amine, when R=Me, 30 > 20 > 10.
In the aqueous solution the order of basicity of amine, when R= Me, 20 > 10 > 30
In the aqueous solution the order of basicity of amine, when R= Et, 20 > 30 > 10

Q2
What is the difference between amine and amide?
Amines and amides are two different types of organic compounds. The difference between amine and amide is the presence of a carbonyl group in their structure; amines have no carbonyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom; the formula of amine is RNH2 whereas amides have a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen atom; the formula of amide is R-CO- NH2.

Q3
What are the uses of amines ?
Amines are used as water purification, medicine manufacturing and development of insecticides and pesticides. It is also involved in the production of amino acids which is the building block of proteins .

Q4
Are amines harmful?
Generally most of the aliphatic amine found in the food, are involved in the production of amino acids,which is the building block of proteins. So these are not highly toxic in nature, However some aromatic amines cause irritans on the skin and may be toxic in nature.

Types of Biomolecules
Types of Biomolecules

There are four major classes of Biomolecules –  Carbohydrates, Proteins, Nucleic acids and Lipids. Each of them is discussed below.

Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are chemically defined as polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or compounds which produce them on hydrolysis. In layman’s terms, we acknowledge carbohydrates as sugars or substances that taste sweet. They are collectively called as saccharides (Greek: sakcharon = sugar). Depending on the number of constituting sugar units obtained upon hydrolysis, they are classified as monosaccharides (1 unit), oligosaccharides (2-10 units) and polysaccharides (more than 10 units). They have multiple functions’ viz. they’re the most abundant dietary source of energy; they are structurally very important for many living organisms as they form a major structural component, e.g. cellulose is an important structural fibre for plants.

Proteins
Proteins are another class of indispensable biomolecules, which make up around 50per cent of the cellular dry weight. Proteins are polymers of amino acids arranged in the form of polypeptide chains. The structure of proteins is classified as primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary in some cases. These structures are based on the level of complexity of the folding of a polypeptide chain. Proteins play both structural and dynamic roles. Myosin is the protein that allows movement by contraction of muscles. Most enzymes are proteinaceous in nature.

Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids refer to the genetic material found in the cell that carries all the hereditary information from parents to progeny. There are two types of nucleic acids namely, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The main function of nucleic acid is the transfer of genetic information and synthesis of proteins by processes known as translation and transcription. The monomeric unit of nucleic acids is known as nucleotide and is composed of a nitrogenous base, pentose sugar, and phosphate. The nucleotides are linked by a 3’ and 5’ phosphodiester bond. The nitrogen base attached to the pentose sugar makes the nucleotide distinct. There are 4 major nitrogenous bases found in DNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil. The DNA structure is described as a double-helix or double-helical structure which is formed by hydrogen bonding between the bases of two antiparallel polynucleotide chains. Overall, the DNA structure looks similar to a twisted ladder.

,,,Polymers,"What Are Polymers?
A polymer is a large molecule or a macromolecule, which essentially is a combination of many subunits. The term polymer in Greek means ‘many parts’. Polymers can be found all around us, from the strand of our DNA, which is a naturally occurring biopolymer, to polypropylene which is used throughout the world as plastic.


Polymers can be naturally found in plants and animals (natural polymers) or can be human-made (synthetic polymers). Different polymers have a number of unique physical and chemical properties, due to which they find usage in everyday life.

FAQs

Polymers are created by the process of polymerization, wherein their constituent elements, called monomers, are reacted together to form polymer chains, i.e., 3-dimensional networks forming the polymer bonds.

The type of polymerization mechanism used depends on the type of functional groups attached to the reactants. In the biological context, almost all macromolecules are either completely polymeric or are made up of large polymeric chains.

Classification of Polymers
Polymers cannot be classified under one category because of their complex structures, different behaviours and vast applications. We can, therefore, classify polymers based on the following norms.

Classification of Polymers Based on the Source of Availability
There are three types of classification under this category, namely, natural, synthetic, and semi-synthetic polymers.

Natural Polymers
They occur naturally and are found in plants and animals. For example, proteins, starch, cellulose and rubber. To add up, we also have biodegradable polymers called biopolymers.

Semi-synthetic Polymers
They are derived from naturally occurring polymers and undergo further chemical modification. For example, cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate.

Synthetic Polymers
These are human-made polymers. Plastic is the most common and widely used synthetic polymer. It is used in industries and various dairy products. For example, nylon-6, 6, polyether, etc.

Classification of Polymers Based on the Structure of the Monomer Chain
This category has the following classifications:

Linear Polymers
The structure of polymers containing long and straight chains falls into this category. PVC, i.e., polyvinyl chloride, is largely used for making pipes, and an electric cable is an example of a linear polymer.

Branched-chain Polymers
When linear chains of a polymer form branches, then such polymers are categorised as branched chain polymers. For example, low-density polythene.

Cross-linked Polymers
They are composed of bifunctional and trifunctional monomers. They have a stronger covalent bond in comparison to other linear polymers. Bakelite and melamine are examples of cross-linked polymers.

Other Ways to Classify Polymers
Classification Based on Polymerization
Addition Polymerization: For example, poly ethane, Teflon, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), etc.
Condensation Polymerization: Examples include nylon -6, 6, perylene, polyesters, etc.
Classification Based on Monomers
Homomer: In this type, a single type of monomer unit is present. For example, polyethene.
Heteropolymer or co-polymer: It consists of different types of monomer units. For example, nylon -6, 6.
Classification Based on Molecular Forces
Elastomers: These are rubber-like solids, and weak interaction forces are present in them. For example, rubber.
Fibres: Strong, tough, high tensile strength and strong forces of interaction are present. For example, nylon -6, 6.
Thermoplastics: These have intermediate forces of attraction. For example, polyvinyl chloride.
Thermosetting polymers: These polymers greatly improve the material’s mechanical properties. It provides enhanced chemical and heat resistance. For example, phenolics, epoxies and silicones.

Structure of Polymers
Most of the polymers around us are made up of a hydrocarbon backbone. A hydrocarbon backbone is a long chain of linked carbon and hydrogen atoms, possibly due to the tetravalent nature of carbon.

A few examples of hydrocarbon backbone polymers are polypropylene, polybutylene and polystyrene. Also, there are polymers which, instead of carbon, have other elements in their backbone. For example, nylon contains nitrogen atoms in the repeated unit backbone.

Types of Polymers
On the basis of the type of backbone chain, polymers can be divided into

Organic Polymers: Carbon backbone
Inorganic Polymers: Backbone constituted by elements other than carbonPolymers image
On the basis of their synthesis:

Natural Polymers
Synthetic Polymers
Biodegradable Polymers
Polymers which are degraded and decayed by microorganisms, like bacteria, are known as biodegradable polymers. These types of polymers are used in surgical bandages, capsule coatings, etc. For example, poly hydroxybutyrate co vel [PHBV]

High-temperature Polymers
These polymers are stable at high temperatures. Due to their high molecular weight, these are not destroyed even at very high temperatures. They are extensively used in the healthcare industries, for making sterilisation equipment and in the manufacturing of heat and shock-resistant objects.

A few of the important polymers are

Polypropylene: It is a type of polymer that softens beyond a specific temperature allowing it to be moulded, and on cooling, it solidifies. Due to its ability to be easily moulded into various shapes, it has a lot of applications.

A few of which are in stationary equipment, automotive components, reusable container speakers and much more. Due to its relatively low energy surface, the polymer is fused with the welding process and not using glue.

Polyethene: It is the most common type of plastic found around us. Mostly used in packaging, from plastic bags to plastic bottles. There are different types of polyethene, but their common formula is (C2H4)n.

Properties of Polymers
Physical Properties
As chain length and cross-linking increase, the tensile strength of the polymer increases.
Polymers do not melt, and they change state from crystalline to semi-crystalline.
Chemical Properties
Compared to conventional molecules with different side molecules, the polymer is enabled by hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding resulting in better cross-linking strength.
Dipole-dipole bonding side chains enable the polymer for high flexibility.
Polymers with Van der Waals forces linking chains are known to be weak but give the polymer a low melting point.
Optical Properties
Due to their ability to change their refractive index with temperature, as in the case of PMMA and HEMA: MMA, they are used in lasers for applications in spectroscopy and analytical applications.

Some Polymers and Their Monomers
Polypropene, also known as polypropylene, is made up of monomer propene.
Polystyrene is an aromatic polymer, naturally transparent, made up of monomer styrene.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a plastic polymer made of monomer vinyl chloride.
The urea-formaldehyde resin is a non-transparent plastic obtained by heating formaldehyde and urea.
Glyptal is made up of monomers ethylene glycol and phthalic acid.
Bakelite or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride is a plastic which is made up of monomers phenol and aldehyde.

Types of Polymerization Reactions
Addition Polymerization
This is also called chain growth polymerization. In this, small monomer units join to form a giant polymer. In each step, the length of the chain increases. For example, polymerization of ethane in the presence of peroxides.

Condensation Polymerization
In this type, small molecules like H2O, CO, NH3, are eliminated during polymerization (step growth polymerization). Generally, organic compounds containing bifunctional groups, such as idols, dials, diamines and dicarboxylic acids, undergo this type of polymerization reaction. For example, preparation of nylon -6, 6.

What Is Copolymerization?
In this process, two different monomers join to form a polymer. Synthetic rubbers are prepared by this polymerization. For example, BUNA – S.

How to Calculate the Molecular Mass of Polymers?
There are two types of average molecular masses of polymers.

Number Average Molecular Masses
Weight Average Molecular Mass
Number Average Molecular Masses
If N1, N2, N3…. are the number of macromolecular with molecular masses. M1, M2, M3….., respectively, then the number average molecular masses of the polymer is given by

 
 
The number average molecular mass is determined by colligative properties such as osmotic pressure.
Weight Average Molecular Mass
If m1, m2, m3…. are the masses of a macromolecule with molecular masses M1, M2, M3…, respectively, then the weight average molecular mass of the polymer is given by
 
Polydispersive index: It is the ratio of the weight average molecular mass and the number average molecular mass of polymers.

 For natural polymers, PDI = 1.

FAQs on Polymers
How do polymers have different physical properties? Give examples.
In polymers, monomers are bonded by different molecular interactions. The nature of these interactions yields polymers of varying elasticity, tensile strength, toughness, thermal stability, etc.

Monomers form a linear chain with weak bonding. These polymers exhibit elasticity and are called elastomers. Examples: neoprene, Buna-S and Buna-R.
Polymers with strong forces of interaction between the monomer in both linear and between the chains have higher tensile strength and are used as fibres. Examples: Polyamides (nylon6,6) and polyesters (terylene).
Polymers having their intermolecular force in between the elastomers and fibres are thermoplastics. They can be repeatedly reprocessed without much change in their polymeric properties. Examples: Polythene and polyvinyl.
Monomers that undergo heavy branching get fused on heating and cannot be reused or reprocessed. Such materials are thermosetting plastics. Bakelite and Urea-formaldehyde are examples.
What is the vulcanization of rubber?
Natural rubber is highly elastic to be of poor physical stability. Adding 5% of sulphur enhances the crosslinking of the linear chains and, thus, improves the stiffening of the rubber for an application like vehicle tires.

These polymers possess high strength and resistance to chemical, thermal and abrasion, similar to ceramics and metals for use in engineering applications. Examples: silicone, polycarbonate, ABS and polysulfone.

The polymer that is similar to the metal in terms of its electrical, electronic, magnetic and optical properties is termed an ‘intrinsically conducting polymer (ICP)’ or ‘synthetic metal’.",,,,,
,,,Chemistry in Everyday Life,"If you are studying chemistry, then you must have wondered about the importance of chemistry in everyday life. Chemistry is the branch of science which deals with the investigation of the properties and changes of matter. From the way how our body exchanges oxygen to how our universe was created, all have a part of chemistry associated with it.

Chemicals of Food in Everyday Life

Dyes are coloured organic compounds that are used to impart colour to various substrates, including paper, leather, fur, hair, drugs and cosmetics. Dyes are classified into natural dyes and synthetic dyes.

Chemistry of Cleansing Agents in Everyday Life
What are soap and detergents?
Soaps are sodium or potassium salt of higher carboxylic acid such as stearic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid, whereas detergents contain a long chain of alkyl groups. Detergents, in comparison to soaps, can also function in hard water.

Saponification: Alkaline hydrolysis of triesters of glycerol to form soap is known as saponification. Soap does not function in hard water since they precipitate in it.

How do soaps work?
Soaps are generally sodium or potassium salts of long-chain fatty acids. Soap molecules have a hydrophobic as well as a hydrophilic part. While the hydrophilic part clings to the water when washing, the hydrophobic end clings to the dirt particles. Thus, when we pour away the water, the dirt particles wash away with the soap molecules.

The Expiration Date on Bottled Drinking Water
Have you ever wondered why there is an expiration date on a bottle of drinking water? After all, it is just water, isn’t it? Well, most of us haven’t even noticed that there is, in fact, an expiration date on the bottle. The idea behind instilling an expiration on bottled drinking water is to standardise its packaging quality.

What the actual expiration date signifies is if the expiration date is up, the taste of the water will be different as there is a chance that the chemicals in the packaging material may ruin the quality of the water.

Elements in the Human Body
We all know that our body is about 60% water, but then what composes the rest of it? Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen. These elements compose 96% of the human body. Whereas the rest 4% is composed of about 60 elements. Some of these elements include calcium, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur.

,,Biology,Reproduction in Plants,"Reproduction : - Reproduction is the production of young ones like parents.

Two categories of Reproduction :-

1) Asexual Reproduction         2) Sexual Reproduction

1.1 Asexual Reproduction

Definition : It is the process resulting in the production of genetically identical progeny from a single organism and inherits the genes of the parent.

Clones : Morphologically and genetically identical individuals.

Different Modes a Asexual Reproduction : - 
1) Fragmentation : - When multicellular organisms break into fragments, these fragments grow into new individuals.

Example - Spirogyra

2) Budding : - This mode of reproduction occurs by producing one or more outgrowths (buds) from the parent body. These buds on seperation develop into new individual.

Example - Yeast

3) Spore Formation : Reproduction that occurs by flagellated, motile zoospores which can grow independently into new individuals.

Example : Chlamydomonas .

Spore Formation in chlamydomonas


Other methods of Asexual Reproduction 

Binary Fission - Amoeba, Paramoecium
Conidia Formation - Penicillium
Gemmules Formation - Sponges
VEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION

This mode of reproduction occurs in plants through their vegetative parts.

New plants formed are genetically identical to their parents.

Artificial Methods of Reproduction in Plants :

A. Cutting : 
The small piece of any vegetative part of a plant having one or more buds is used for propagation.
Stem cutting - Rose, Bougainvillea , Leaf Cutting - Sansvieria , Root Cutting - Blackberry
B. Grafting :

Here parts of two plants are joined in such a way that they grow as one plant.

Process : Part of stem containing more than one bud (Scion) is joined onto a rooted plant called stock, is called Grafting.

When only one bud is joined on the stock , it is called bud grafting.

Eg: Apple, pear, rose, etc.

C. Tissue culture : 

In this method a small amount of plant tissue is carefully grown to give many plant lets.

Micropropagation method is also used now a days.




1.2 Sexual Reproduction 

It involves fusion of two compatible gametes or sex cells when the organisms reach maturity.

In Plants : End of juvenile or vegetative phase = beginning of reproductive phase.

(a. Juvenile phase – The period between birth and sexual maturity is called juvenile phase. In plants it is known as vegetative phase)

Reproductive Structure : Flower ( in Plants )
Function : Produce Haploid Gametes & Ensure fertilization takes place.

Two major events of sexual reproduction :- 
1) Meiosis 
2) Fusion of gametes

Three Stages of Sexual Reproduction :
1) Pre-fertilization 
2) Fertilization 
3) Post-Fertilization 
Parts of flower


Androecium : Male Reproductive whorl of flower
Stamen : Individual member of Androecium

Parts of Stamen :

1) Filament 2) Connective 3) Anther

Structure of Anther :

 It is generally dithecous (having two lobes) & tetrasponrongiate (containing 4 pollen sacs)

In Monothecous anther contains two pollen sacs.

Ts of anther 12th biology


T.S of  anther-

It consist of anther wall and microsporangia ( pollen sacs).

There are four layers of the wall of mature anther.

 Epidermis : It is the outermost protective layer made of protective tabular cells.

Endothecium : Sub-Epidermal layer made of radially elongated cells with fibrous thickenings.

Middle Layer : Made of thin walled cells. It is multi-layered and surrounds microsporangium . It degenerates at maturity.

Tapetum :- It is the innermost wall layer which surrounds the sporogenous tissue of microsporangium.

Tapetum provides nutrition to developing pollen grains ( microspores ). 
Tapatem contain ubisch bodies which produce sporopollenin ( a component of exine).

B. Microsporangium ( pollen Sac ):
Microsporangium is present inner to the tapetum.
Initially it is made up of a compact mass of diploid sporogenous tissue. 
Cells of sporogenous tissue functions as microspore mother cells or pollen mother cells (PMC). 

At maturity diploid (2n) PMC undergoes meiosis to form four haploid (n) pollen grains (microspores). Process is called as microsporogenesis. 

Pollen grains are produced in the form of tetrad.




Structure of microspore: ( Pollen grain ) 

1) Typical pollen grain is a non-motile, haploid, unicellular body with single nucleus.
2) It is surrounded by a two layered wall - sporoderm.
Sporoderm consist of two layers :-
 1. Exine : Outer Layer, Thick, made of Sporopollenin.
It can be smooth or with sculptured pattern ( characteristic of species)
It is resistant to chemicals.
 2. Intine : Inner, made of Cellulose & Pectin.

Germ Pores :  At some places exine is very thin showing thin areas known as germ-pores.

Pollen viability - Viability is the functional ablity of pollen grain to germinate to develop male gametophyte) 
It depends upon environmental conditions of temperature and humidity. 

Eg. It is 30 minutes in rice and wheat.
 In some members of family Solanaceae, Rosaceae, Leguminosae, it lasts even for months




Development of Male Gametophyte

Pollen Grain = Beginning of male gametophyte

Steps of Development of male gametophyte : -

1. First Mitotic Division :- Production of bigger vegetative cell (rich in food) and small generative cell.
2. Second Mitotic Division : - Generative cell give rise to two non-motile male gametes,.
It takes place in pollen grain or pollen tube.

Development of male gametophyte 12th biology maharashtra board


In Most Angiosperms, pollen grains are shed from anther at this stage.

Gynoecium : Female reproductive whorl of flower . (PISTIL)

Carpel/ Megasporophyll : Individual member of gynoecium.

Apocarpous : Many Free carpels            Syncarpous : Many carpels fused together.

Parts of Carpel : Ovary, Style & Stigma.

Structure of Anatropous Ovule
Anatropous Ovule :- Micropyle is directed downwards and Is present adjacent to the funiculus.

Structure of Anatropous Ovule


Ovule is attached to placenta by funiculus. Narrow Opening at apex of ovule is called micropyle.

Funiculus is attached to main body through hilum. Chalaza is Base of Ovule.

Central Parenchymatous Tissue : Nucellus

Nucellus is covered by two protective coverings (integuments) : Outer Integument & Inner Integument

Embryo Sac is present inside nucellus.






MEGASPOROGENESIS
Megasporogenesis : It is the process of formation of haploid megaspores from diploid megaspore mother cell (MMC).



Development Of Female Gametophyte :-

Development of female gametophyte


1) Megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to form linear tetrad of haploid cells i.e. megaspore. 

2) Upper three megaspores abort and lowest one towards centre of nucellus remains functional. 

3) It undergoes three successive, free nuclear mitotic divisions forming 8 nuclei, four located at each pole. 

4) One nucleus from each pole migrates towards the centre (polar nuclei).

5) Three nuclei towards micropylar end constitute egg apparatus. Large & Central - egg cell and two Supporting - synergid Cells.. Synergids contain filiform apparatus to guide pollen tube towards egg cell. 

6) Antipodal cells are group of three cells present at the chalazal end. 

7) The two haploid polar nuclei of large central cell fuse to form diploid secondary nucleus or definitive nucleus, just prior to fertilization. 

8) This seven- celled and eight nucleated structure is called an embryo sac. 

9) Female gametophyte is colourless, endosporic and is concealed in the ovule enclosed by ovary.

Monosporic Development - It is a  method of embryo sac development from a single megaspore. .

Endosporous Development :   The development of female gametophyte happens within the megaspore.(In angiosperms)





1.6 Pollination 
Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of the flower.

TYPES OF POLLINATION :- 

Self Pollination :- Self pollination is a type of pollination which occurs in a single flower or two flowers on a single plant. (inbreeding or selfing.)

Cross Pollination :- Cross pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of another flower of different plants of same species.
 TYPES OF POLLINATION : - (on basis of source of pollination)

Points	Autogamy (self pollination) :	Geitonogamy :	 Xenogamy (cross polination/ out breeding) :
Definition	It is a type of pollination in which bisexual flower is pollinated by its own pollen grains.	It is the transfer of pollen grain to a stigma of a different flower produced on the same plant.	It is a type of cross pollination when pollen grain of one flower is deposited on the stigma
of a flower of different plant belonging to same species
Genetical Variation	Offsprings are genetically identical to their parents 	Offsprings are genetically identical to their parents 	Offsprings are not genetically identical to their parents .
Self/Cross pollination	A type of self pollination.	Similar to Autogamy (self pollination) and Xenogamy (cross pollination)	A type of cross pollination.
Pollinating Agents	Not involved	Involved	Involved
Example	Pea	Cucurbita maxima.	Papaya




For pollination, pollinating agents are required. They are of two types , 

Abiotic ( Wind, water, etc.)  & Biotic (Birds, Insects, Bats, Snails, etc.)

Abiotic Agents :  Non-living agents including wind and water.

1.       Pollination by Wind (Anemophily)

Found in Most important crop plants.

 

Adaptations in Anemophilous flowers :

1.       Flowers – small, inconspicuous and colourless.

2.       They lack nectar and fragrance.

3.       Pollen Grains – light, dry

4.       Large number of pollen grains are produced to increase chances of pollination.

5.       Stigma – feathery (traps pollen grains)

6.       Stamens – long filaments , Versatile anthers

7.       Stamens and Stigmas exposed to air

Eg:- Rice , Wheat, Maize, etc.

Fig :- Pollination by wind –  Maize

 



2.       Pollination by Water ( Hydrophily )

Found in 30 genera of aquatic monocots.

Adaptations in hydrophilous flowers :

1.       Flowers – Small , inconspicuous.

2.       Perianth and other floral parts unwettablev

3.       Pollen grains- long, unwettable (mucilage present)

4.       They lack nectar and fragrance.

Types of Hydrophily :-

1.       Hypohydrophily : Pollination occurs below surface of water.

Pollen grains are long, without exine, heavier than water , sink down to meet stigma of female flowers.

Eg: Zostera (sea horse)

2.       Epihydrophily :  Pollination occurs on the surface of water.

Specific gravity of pollen grains is equal to that of water, so they float on water.

Eg: In Vallisneria ,Female flowers reach water surface to ensure pollination.

 



Fig – Male and female plant Vallisneria

B. Biotic Agents : It Includes living agents like insects,birds,etc. About 80% plants require it.

 

1.       Pollination by Insects (Entomophily) :

Adaptations in entomophilous flowers :-

1)      Flowers – Large, brightly coloured.

2)      They have nectar glands and produce sweet smell (fragrance).

3)      Stigma – Rough (hair present) or Sticky (mucilaginous secretion)

4)      Pollen grains – spiny , surrounded by pollen kit

5)      Special adaptations in some plants e.g. turn-pipe mechanism in Salvia.

Eg: Rose, Jasmine, Cestrum, etc.





2.       Pollination by Birds (Ornithophily)

Few Birds specialized – like – Sun birds and humming birds . Small size , long beaks.

Adaptations in Ornithophilous Flowers :-

1.       Flowers – Large, brightly coloured.

2.       Secrete profuse, dilute nectar.

3.       Pollen grains – sticky and spiny.

4.       They don’t have fragrance .

Eg: Butea, bombax, Callistemon (Bottle Brush)




 
3.       Pollination by Bats (Chiropteryphily)

Bats can transport pollens over long distances.

Adaptations in Chiropterphilous Flowers :-

1.       Flowers – dull coloured

2.       Abundant nectar and strong fragrance.

3.       Large amount of edible pollen grains produced.

Eg: Anthocephalous (kadamb tree), Adansonia (Baobab tree), Kigelia (Sausage Tree), etc.





1.7 Outbreeding Devices (contrivances)

Outbreeding devices : Mechanisms that discourage or prevent self pollination.

I helps to increase genetic diversity which is an essential factor for evolution by natural selection.
Continued self pollination results in inbreeding depression.

Different inbreeding devices are :-

1) Unisexuality : Plant bears either male or female flowers. (dioecism).
eg: Mulberry, Papaya.

2) Dichogamy : Anthers and stigmas mature at different times in a bisexual flower.

Dichogamy is of two types : 

- 1) Protandry : Androecium matures earlier than gynoecium.
eg: disc florets of sunflower .

- 2) Protogyny : Gynoecium matures earlier than androecium.
eg : Gloriosa

3) Prepotency : Pollen grains of other flowers germinate rapidly over the stigma than the pollen grains from the same flower .
eg : Apple.

4) Heterostyly (heteromorphy) : There are two or more types of flowers in which stigmas and anthers are placed at different levels .
In heteromorphic flowers, pollen grains produced from anther pollinate stigmas produced at same level.

5) Herkogamy : Natural physical barrier between two sex organs and prevent contact of pollen with stigma of same flower . 
eg : Calotropis - Pentangular stigma is positioned above the level of anthers.

6) Self Incompatibility (self sterility) :  Genetic mechanism due to which the germination of pollen on stigma of same flower is inhibited.
eg: Tobacco, Thea.




1.8 Pollen-Pistil Interaction

All the events from the deposition of pollen grain on stigma to the entry of he pollen tube in the ovule ( synergid) are referred as pollen - pistil interaction. 

What happens when wrong type of pollen lands on a stigma of a flower ?
Answer : When the wrong type of pollen lands on the stigma it is discarded by pistil. The pistil has ability to recognise and accept the right or compatible pollen of the same species. It is done with help of special proteins . The process involves pollen recognition followed by promootion or inhibition of pollen.

 The journey of pollen-pistil interaction :

1) The compatible pollen absorbs water and minerals from the surface of the stigma, germinates and produces pollen tube.

2) The sigmatic surface provides essential prerequisites for a successful germination, which are absent in pollen grain.

3) The pollen tube is finally pushed through the ovule and reaches the embryo sac.

4) The tips of the pollen tube finally enters into one of the synergids and then ruptures to release the contents.

Sucrose :  Induces pollen germination & tube growth in vitro.


Boric Acid : Addition facilitates & accelerates pollen germination.

Artificial Hybridization : 

 Only the desired pollen grains are hand pollinated and used for fertilization. This is accomplished through emasculation and bagging procedure.




1.9 Double Fertilization

- It is a complex fertilization mechanism in which both the male gametes from a pollen grain participate.

Discovered by - Nawaschin - in liliaceous plants like Lilium & Fritillaria..

The growth of pollen tube is guided by chemicals secreted by synergids.

Entry of pollen tube into the ovule happens in 3 ways : -

1)  Porogamy :  Pollen tube enters ovule through the micropyle.

2) Chalazogamy :  Pollen tube enters ovule through the chalaza.

3) Mesogamy :  Pollen tube enters the ovule by piercing the integuments.

Note : Pollen tube penetrates embryo sac of ovule through it's micropyar end.


Siphonogamy :  When non-motile male gametes are carried through hollow pollen tube.

 Two events of sexual reproduction takes place in angiospermic plants.

1) Syngamy :  It is the fusion of haploid male gamete with haploid female gamete (egg) to produce a diploid zygote.

2) Triple fusion :  It is the fusion of haploid male gamete with diploid secondary nucleus producing primary endosperm nucleus  (PEN).

Diploid zygote develops into an embryo.

Primary Endosperm Nucleus develops into triploid endosperm.

Syngamy - Generative Fertilization

Triple Fusion :- Vegetative fertilization.





SIGNIFICANCE OF DOUBLE FERTILIZATION : - 

1) Unique feature of angiosperm . It ensures that parent plant invests a seed with a food store, only if the egg is fertilised.",Semi-dwarf rice varieties were developed from IR-8 (International Rice Research Institute) and Taichung native-I (from Taiwan) and introduced in India.,,,,
,,,Human Reproduction in lower and higher animals,"Reproduction-

Reproduction is defined as the biological process of formation of new life forms from pre-existing similar life.
Through reproduction, species can survive over a long period.
Reproduction in animals occur mainly by two methods, i.e. asexual and sexual.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals

Asexual Reproduction in animals-

1. Common and primitive method among animals.
2. Meiosis or the gamete formation and fertilization process does not take place in asexual reproduction.
3. Single parent is involved and offspring identical to parent. Also called clone.
4. E.g. Gemmule formation and budding.

5. Gemmule formation :

Gemmule is an internal bud. In sponges, during unfavourable conditions this method of asexual reproduction is adopted.
Gemmule is thus an asexually produced mass or aggregation of dormant archcocytes cells. They develop into a new organism.
Around archaeocytes, amoebocytes secrete a layer of thick resistant membrane.
Gemmules hatch and develop into new individual when favourable conditions return.
Seen in Spongilla.
6. Budding :

Ii is a simple method of asexual reproduction seen in coelenterates (Hydra and corals) and in some colonial ascidians.
A bud, i.e. small outgrowth is produced towards the basal end of the body, in Hydra.
Bud grows and forms tentacles and develops into a new individual.
This newly formed Hydra later detaches from parent and becomes a separate organism.
Sexual Reproduction in animals-

1. Offspring is produced by fusion of gametes or amphimixes in sexual reproduction. For the formation of gametes, both male and female parent undergo meiosis in their gonads.
2. Two main phases in the life of sexually reproducing animals : Juvenile phase/pre- reproductive phase which involves growth and reproductive/maturity phase in which sex organs undergo maturation.
3. Animals are either seasonal breeders like goat, sheep and donkey which breed only in particular season or continuous breeders like human and apes who can breed throughout the year.

4. Human reproduction :

Sequential steps in the process of human reproduction : gametogenesis, insemination, internal fertilization, zygote formation and embryogenesis, gestation and parturition followed by lactation.
Primary Sex organs – testes (testis : singular) in male and ovaries (ovary : singular) in female.
Secondary or accessory Sex organs – Organs other than testis in male and organs other i than ovaries in female.
Secondary sexual characters in males – Presence of beard, moustache, hair on the chest, muscular body, enlarged larynx (Adam’s apple), etc.
Secondary sexual characters in females – Developed breast, broader pelvis, high pitched voice, etc.
Sexual dimorphism : The phenomena by which sexes can be identified externally.
5. Male Reproduction System : Parts of male reproductive system – Testes, accessory ducts, glands
and external genitalia.
(1) Testes

(2) Accessory ducts:

(3) Glands :

4) External Ganitalia:
Terms associated with external genitalia of male:

Inguinal canal : The passage through which testes descend into scrotum.
Gubernaculum : Fibro-muscular band present in the scrotum.
Cryptorchidism : Failure of testis to descend into scrotum which may cause sterility.
Three bundles of erectile tissues in penis :
 Paired Corpora cavernosa
Median corpus spongiosum.
6. Semen : Single ejaculate of semen is 2.5 to 4.00 ml of viscous, alkaline and milky fluid (pH 7.2 to 7.7) containing 400 million sperms and secretions of epididymis, prostate gland, and Cowper’s glands. It is rich in fructose, Ca++ , bicarbonates and prostaglandins.

7. Histology of testis :

External coverings of testis seen in L.S. from outer to inner side tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea and tunica vasculosa.
Testicular mass divided into 200-300 testicular lobules by tunica albuginea.
Each lobule has 1-4 seminiferous tubules.
In between the seminiferous tubules there are interstitial cells of Leydig or Leydig’s cells. They secrete the male hormone androgen or i testosterone.
Internal lining of cuboidal germinal epithelial cells or spermatogonia inside the seminiferous l tubules.
Few large pyramidal cells called Sertoli or sub-tentacular cells (nurse cells) Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the developing sperms,
Various stages of developing sperms such as spermatogonia, primary spermatocyte, secondary spermatocyte, spermatids and sperms are seen in the seminiferous tubules.
8. Female Reproductive System : The female reproductive system consists of the following parts :

A pair of ovaries
A pair of fallopian tubes. (Also called oviducts, but usually this term is used for lower animals)
Uterus
Vagina
External genitalia (vulva)
A pair of vestibular glands
A pair of mammary glands

9. Puberty / Sexual maturity in Females :

Menarche : Onset of menstrual cycle, usually occurs at the age 10-14 years.
The reproductive system then becomes functional.
Menopause : End of menstrual cycles in females, usually occurs at the age of 45-50 years.
Reproductive age of female : The period from menarche to menopause.
10. Structure and development of the ovary : The process of oogenesis starts in ovary much before the birth of the female baby. The various developing follicles and their fate is shown in the following flow chart :

11. Histology of ovary :

TWo parts in ovary : Central part is medulla while the peripheral part is called cortex.
Layer of germinal epithelium covers the cortex.
Germinal epithelial cells form groups of oogonia in the form of cords called egg tubes of Pfluger which project into the cortex. Each cord ends in egg nest, which is group of oogonial cells. The primordial ovarian follicles develop from these cells.
Different stages of development of oocyte viz. primordial follicle, primary follicle, secondary follicle, Graafian follicle, rupturing Graafian follicle, corpus luteum, corpus albicans are seen in a cortex of mature ovary.
Medulla has blood vessels, lymph vessels and theca externa.
Graafian follicle is a mature ovarian follicle with eccentric secondary oocyte in a fluid filled cavity called antrum surrounded by membrane granulosa, theca interna and theca externa.
The ovum is surrounded by vitelline membrane, zona pellucida and membrana * granulosa.
In the antrum, ovum is situated on discus proligerus. Ovum along with discus proligerus ; is called cumulus oophorus. Antrum is filled : with liquor folliculi.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals

Menstrual cycle (Ovarian cycle)-

1. Primates show menstrual cycle. Human female shows cycle with 28 days periodicity.
2. It involves a series of cyclic changes in the ovary and uterus.

3. Menstual cycle:

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals 9

4. If the ovum is fertilized corpus luteum is retained.
5. A once embryo gets implanted in the endometrium, it starts secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which extends the life of corpus luteum.
6. Presence of hCG in maternal blood and urine is an indicator of pregnancy.
7. If ovum is not fertilized, corpus luteum regresses and forms corpus albicans. Then the next menstrual cycle begins.

Gametogenesis-

1. The process of formation of gametes in sexually reproducing animals is called gametogenesis.
2. Sperm is the male gamete and ovum/egg is the female gamete.
3. The gametes are formed from primordial germ cells of gonads.
4. Spermatogenesis : The process by which sperms are formed is called spermatogenesis.

In the testis, i.e. male gonads there are seminiferous tubules which are lined by germinal epithelium.
Cells of germinal epithelium undergo spermatogenesis and form sperms.
In between the germinal cells there are nurse cells or cells of Sertoli which provide nourishment to the developing sperms.
(1) Phases of spermatogenesis : There are three phases of spermatogenesis, viz. multiplication phase, growth phase and maturation phase. Germinal cells are called primordial germ cells.

Multiplication phase : Repeated mitotic divisions produce large number of spermatogonia which are diploid (2n).
Growth phase : The spermatogonium accumulates food and grows in size. This is now called primary spermatocyte.
Maturation phase : The primary spermatocyte undergoes first meiotic division. At the end of this division two haploid secondary spermatocytes are formed. Secondary spermatocyte
undergoes second meiotic division and produce spermatid.
Spermatids are non-motile and non-functional. They undergo metamorphosis in the process of spermiogenesis and mature into motile sperms. Each haploid spermatogonium thus forms four haploid spermatids which later transform into the sperms.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals

(2) Changes occurring during spermiogenesis :

Increase in sperm length
Distinction of centrioles into proximal and distal one.
Formation of axial filament from distal centriole
Formation of spirally coiled mitochondria.
Formation of acrosome from Golgi complex.
(3) Structure of the sperm (spermatozoa) :

Microscopic, elongated haploid motile male gamete measuring about 0.055 mm (60 /;) in length.
Produced by the process of spermatogenesis.
Their viability remains viable for seventy- two hours, but can fertilize the ovum in first 12 to 14 hours only.
(4) Parts of sperm:

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals 10

5. Oogenesis : Oogenesis takes place in ovary by which the secondary oocyte is formed.
(1) Phases of oogenesis :

Phase of multiplication : In the phase of multiplication, large number of oogonia are formed.
Phase of growth : In the phase of growth, one of the oogonia becomes large. It is now called primary oocyte.
Phase of maturation : In this phase the rimary oocyte undergoes meiosis-I and forms large haploid secondary oocyte. There is equal nuclear division but unequal cytoplasmic division during the phase of maturation. Secondary oocyte and polar bodies undergo arrested meiotic-I division. Secondary oocyte completes the meiosis-II if and only if it undergoes fertilization.
(2) Structure of ovum, i.e. secondary oocyte : j

The ovum discharged by the ovary during ovulation is actually a secondary oocyte.
Rounded, haploid, non-mo tile. Female gamete is largest cell of the body.
Measures about 0.1 mm or 100 in diameter.
It is microlecithal, i.e. almost free of yolk.
It has abundant cytoplasm or ooplasm having a large eccentric nucleus surrounded by vitelline membrane.
Centriole is absent in the ovum.
Ovum shows polarity having two poles.
Animal pole is the side which shows the presence of polar body and nucleus while the opposite side is termed as vegetal pole.
The ovum is enclosed by two additional coats inner, thin, transparent and noncellular zona pellucida and outer, thick cellular corona radiata.
Between the vitelline membrane and zona pellucida there is a narrow perivitelline space.
The zona pellucida is secreted by ovum j itself while corona radiata is formed of radially elongated follicular cells which are glued together by hyaluronic acid.
Fertilization/Syngamy-

1. Fertilization : Process of fusion of the haploid male and female gametes into diploid zygote is called fertilization.
2. Fertilization is internal and in the ampulla of the fallopian tube the gametes meet.
3. The sequence of events of fertilization :

Capacitation of sperms : Movement of sperms towards the secondary oocyte.
Release of acrosomal enzymes: Enzymes are secreted by sperm head when it touches secondary oocyte.
Separation of cells of corona radiata : This happens due to acrosomal enzymes like hyaluronidase and corona penetrating enzymes.
Compatibility reaction/ Fertilizin-anti fertilizin interaction : Fertilizin of egg binds with anti fertilizin of sperm. The zona pellucida of egg has fertilizin receptor proteins (ZP3, ZP2). Also acrosome ruptures releasing enzyme acrosin / zona lysin.
Acrosome reaction : Acrosin dissolves zona pellucida and vitelline membrane at the point of contact of sperm head.
Entry of sperm nucleus in ovum : Nucleus and centriole enter the ovum.
Formation of fertilization membrane/ Cortical reaction : Vitelline membrane of ovum is converted into a fertilization membrane. This prevents polyspermy.
Activation of ovum : Completion of meiosis- II of secondary oocyte takes place. When ovum receives centriole from sperm, it completes meiosis-II. This releases second polar body.
Syngamy/Karyogamy : Fusion of male pronucleus and female pronucleus. Synkaryon is formed after fusion of male and female nucleus.
Formation of diploid zygote conclude the process of fertilization
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals

4. Significance of fertilization :

Secondary oocyte can complete meiosis only after fertilization.
Diploid number of chromosomes is restored in the zygote.
Genetic characters of two parents can be mixed leading to variation and evolution.
It determines the sex of young one.
Only through fertilization centrioles are introduced into the ovum which are otherwise absent in ovum.
Embryonic development-

1. After syngamy the zygote that is formed undergoes divisions to form embryo. These mitotic divisions are called cleavages.
2. When the zygote passes through the fallopian tube, the cleavages start.
3. Till morula stage, zona pellucida layer is retained as it prevents the implantation of the blastocyst at an abnormal site.

4. Cleavage :

Cleavages are rapid mitotic divisions of zygote to form a hollow spherical multicellular blastula. Cleavage converts the zygote first into a mass of cells called morula.
Cleavage occurs during its passage through the fallopian tube to the uterus.
In human beings, cleavage is holoblastic, equal and indeterminate.
Cleavage divisions are rapid with short interphase.
There is no time for cells to grow in size.
Thus, cells become progressively smaller. The resulting daughter cells are called blastomeres.
Cleavage shows faster synthesis of DNA.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals 11

5. Blastulation :

During blastulation hollow and multicellular blastocyst is formed from 16-32 celled stage of morula.
Blastocyst now reaches uterus and starts absorbing glycogen rich uterine milk.
The outer layer of cells forms trophoblast layer whereas inner large cells form inner cell mass or embryoblast.
Size of blastocyst doubles from 0.15 mm to 0. 30 mm.
Due to the absorption of glycogen rich uterine milk, the trophoblast cells become flat and a cavity called blastocyst cavity is formed.
Cells of rauber : These are the cells of trophoblast which are in contact with the embryonal knob.
Blastocyst becomes fully developed by the end of the 7th day.
6. Implantation :

Implantation is the process of embedding the blastocyst in the uterine endometrium for further gestation.
On 7th to 10th day after fertilization, implantation takes place. Embryo is completely buried inside the endometrium.
Trophoblast divides into two layers, viz. cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. With processes of synctiotrophoblast the blastocyst is buried in the endometrium layer of uterus.
7. Gastrulation :

(1) Formation of gastrula from the blastocyst is called gastrulation. It starts at about 8 days after fertilization.
(2) Two important events during gastrulation are :

Differentiation of blastomeres : Three germinal layers are formed by rearrangement of blastomeres.
Morphogenetic movements : Movements of cells to reach their destined area of differentiation is called morphogenetic movements.
(3) Gastrulation and implantation of blastocyst takes place simultaneously.
(4) Gastrulation involves the following sequential changes :

Formation of endoderm
Formation of embryonic disc
Formation of amniotic cavity
Formation of ectoderm
Formation of mesoderm
Formation of extra-embryonic coelom
Formation of chorion and amnion
8. Organogenesis : Process of forming organs after the process of gastrulation is called organogenesis.
9. Fate of germinal layers : At the end of gastrulation, embryo develops into three germinal layers.
Different tissues and organs are formed from germinal layers. This process is called histogenensis.

Pregnancy / Gestation-

1. Gestation or pregnancy is the condition of developing foetus in the uterus. It may be one or two as in twins.
2. In human beings, gestation period is about 280 days.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals 13

Placenta-

Placenta is a flattened, discoidal organ attached to the wall of the uterus and to the baby’s umbilical cord.
It facilitates the supply of oxygen and nutrients and also for removal of carbon dioxide and excretory products produced by the foetus.
Placenta is the only organ, which is formed of tissues from two different individuals the mother and the foetus.
Foetal placenta is the choronic villi while maternal placenta is the highly vascularized uterine wall. So human placenta is called haemochorial.
The placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces hormones like hCG, progesterone, estrogen and relaxin.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals

Parturition-

Parturition is the birth process which is accompanied with labour pains.
It is a neuro-endocrine mechanism which involves rise in estrogen : progesterone ratio and increase in oxytocin receptors in myometrium of uterine wall.
The fully developed foetus gives signals for the uterine contractions by secreting Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from pituitary and corticosteroids from adrenal gland.
This triggers release of oxytocin from mother’s pituitary gland, which acts on uterine muscles of mother and causes vigorous uterine contractions.
This leads to expulsion of the baby from the uterus.
Parturition involves three stages, viz. dilation stage, expulsion stage and after birth or placental stage.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals 14
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals 15

Lactation-

After parturition the new born is given nourishment through milk. The process of secretion of milk is called lactation in which mammary glands of mother become functional.
The first milk is called colostrum which is rich in proteins, lactose and mother’s antibodies e.g. IgA.
Lactation is also neuroendocrine process, in which almost all endocrine glands of mother are involved.
Reproductive Health-

Total wellbeing of a person’s emotional, behavioural, physical and social aspects involving reproduction is called reproductive health.
In India, Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) programmes are undertaken to improve reproductive health.
One of the objectives of this programme is to control the population growth of India.
Birth Control-

1. For controlling the family size, birth control measures are taken which me called contraceptive measures.
2. Contraceptive methods are of two main types, i.e. temporary and permanent.

Birth control measures:

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 2 Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals 16

3. Medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) :

MTP is induced abortion. This can indirectly control population. MTP is legalized in India since 1971.
MTP is performed if unwanted pregnancy has to be discontinued or if there are defects in the growing foetus. MTP to abort healthy female embryo is illegal.
MTP can be safely done only during the first trimester of pregnancy.
4. Amniocentesis :

Process in which amniotic fluid containing foetal cells is collected using a hollow needle inserted into the uterus under ultrasound guidance.
This is done for studying the chromosomes to check any possible abnormality in the developing foetus.
Sex determination by amniocentesis is legally banned in India.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)-

1. Disease or infections which are transmitted through sexual intercourse are collectively called Sexually Transmited Diseases (STDs) or Venereal Diseases (VDs) or Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI).
The major venereal diseases are syphilis and gonorrhoea.

Infertility-

1. Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive naturally after (one year of) regular unprotected intercourse.
2. Today infertile couples have many options to have a child such as fertility drugs, test tube babies, artificial insemination, IUI, surrogate motherhood, etc.

In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) : When fertilization process is carried out of the body and the embryo is transferred back into the mother’s body, then it is called IVF technique. (Commonly known as test-tube baby.)
Zygote Intra Fallopian Transfer (ZIFT) : The embryo is transferred in the fallopian tubes by ZIFT (Zygote Intra Fallopian Transfer) technique.
Gamete Intra Fallopian Transfer (GIFT) : Transferring the ovum collected from the donor into the fallopian tube of another female who can act as a surrogate mother (a female with suitable environment for fertilization and development) is called GIFT.
ICSI (Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection) : Single sperm cell is injected directly into cytoplasm of an ovum in the laboratory in this technique.
Artificial insemination (AI) : The collected sperms are artificially introduced into the
cervix of female, for the purpose of achieving a pregnancy through in vivo fertilization.
IUI (Intra Uterine Insemination) : Similar to artificial insemination, but in this technique the sperms are introduced into the uterine cavity instead of cervix.
Sperm bank / Semen bank : Sperms are collected from donors and stored in a sperm bank or semen bank. These are stored by cryopreservation method and given to needy couples.
Adoption : A couple or a single parent can legally adopt a child. They also get legal rights, privileges and responsibilities for raising up adopted child.

,,,3. Inheritance and Variation,"Principles of Inheritance and Variation
Heredity is a process of transmission of heritable traits from parents to their offsprings.

Genetics is the branch of biology dealing with the principles and mechanism of inheritance and variation.

Inheritance is the basis of heredity and by this process, traits are passed on from the parents to the offsprings. Continuity of the gene pool is maintained by the process of inheritance.

Genes are the basic unit of inheritance and located on chromosomes.

Variation exists among individuals of one species. Variation is due to crossing over, recombination, mutation and environmental effects on the expression of genes present on chromosomes.

Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance
Gregor Johann Mendel is called “Father of genetics”.

Mendel performed experiments on Garden pea. He took 14 true-breeding plants of pea having seven distinguishable characters, which have two opposite traits.

He called genes as “factors”, which are passed from parents to offsprings.

Genes, that code for a pair of opposite traits are called “alleles”.

seven pairs of contrasting characters in Mendel's experiment

He gave three laws of inheritance based on his observation:

Law of Dominance: One of the alleles is dominant and gets expressed in the phenotype in case of the heterozygote, e.g. When we cross homozygous tall (TT) and dwarf (tt) plants, in the offsprings we get all the tall plants having the genotype Tt, so tallness is a dominant trait over dwarfness.
Law of Segregation of genes: Each allele separates during meiosis at the time of gamete formation. There is no blending and characters are passed to different gametes. Homozygotes produce only one kind of gametes and heterozygotes produce different kinds of gametes.

law of dominance and law of segregation of genes

Law of Independent assortment: It states that alleles for different traits are inherited independently. He showed that using a dihybrid cross.
law of independent assortment

Test Cross: It is to find out the genotype of the plant showing dominant trait, the given plant is crossed with the recessive homozygote. The two observations are:

If the phenotype of offsprings shows only the dominant trait, then the parent plant was homozygote to the dominant trait
If the offsprings produced are of both phenotypes, then the parent plant was heterozygote to the dominant trait.
Incomplete Dominance
When neither of the two alleles is dominant and the phenotype of the heterozygote does not resemble any of the parents. The heterozygote expresses intermediate or a mixture of two parents’ traits
Example: The flower colour inheritance of snapdragon (dog flower). On crossing true breeding red (RR) and white flower (rr), we get all pink colour flowers in the F1 generation, which on self-pollination give red: pink: white flowers in the ratio 1:2:1 in the F2 generation
Incomplete dominance
Co-dominance
When both the alleles express themselves together in an individual, they are said to be co-dominant
Example: The inheritance of the ABO blood group in humans is controlled by the gene I. The gene I has three allelic forms, IA, IB and i. In a human being, any two out of three alleles are presentIA and IB code for different kinds of sugar polymers present on the surface of RBC and ‘i’ does not produce any sugarIA and IB are dominant over ‘i’, but IA and IB are co-dominant and express themselves together.
Co-dominance ABO Blood group
Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
Sutton and Boveri supported Mendel’s observations and stated that chromosomes are the carrier of genes
Chromosomes occur as a homologous pair and the two alleles of a gene are located on the homologous pair of chromosomes at the same site
Homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis in the process of gamete formation
Chromosomes segregate and assort independently
During fertilization, gametes combine and produce the offsprings with the diploid no. of chromosomes, that is similar to the parent
Morgan extensively worked on fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster and provided experimental evidence to support the chromosomal theory of inheritance
Linkage and Recombination
Physical association of genes located on a chromosome is known as linkage
In a dihybrid cross, if the two genes are tightly linked or present on the same chromosome, the parental combination is more prevalent than non-parental combinations or recombinants
The linkage and recombination are directly dependent on the distance between a pair of genes. More the distance, greater is the probability of recombination
Multiple alleles- When a trait is governed by more than two alleles, e.g. ABO blood group.

Polygenic Inheritance- When a trait is governed by multiple independent genes, that have a similar or additive effect on the trait, it is known as polygenic inheritance, e.g. eye colour, skin pigmentation, height, hair colour, etc.

Polygenic inheritance is also affected by environmental conditions.

Pleiotropy- When a single gene controls many phenotypic traits, it is known as a pleiotropic gene. The different phenotypic expressions are mostly a result of the effect of a gene on metabolic pathways.

E.g. a single gene mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase results in the disease known as phenylketonuria, which is characterised by mental retardation, reduced hair and skin pigmentation.

Sex Determination
There are different systems of sex determination present in different organisms.
Henking first observed X chromosome and named it X body.
The chromosomes that determine the development of sexual characters are known as sex chromosomes and the rest of the chromosomes are known as autosomes.
When the male produces two different kinds of gamete, it is known as male heterogamety, e.g. humans, grasshoppers, drosophila, etc.
When the female produces two different kinds of gamete, it is known as female heterogamety, e.g. birds.

Haplo-diploid sex-determination system
Female (queen or worker) is formed by the fusion of an egg and sperm and have diploid (32) no. of chromosomes
Male (drone) is formed from an unfertilized egg by parthenogenesis and have haploid (16) no. of chromosomes. Sperms are produced by mitosis
Mutation
Any changes in the sequence of DNA is called a mutation. Viable mutations get inherited from one generation to another. A mutation changes the genotype as well as the phenotype of an organism
It is linked to various diseases, but not all mutations are harmful
Changes like, deletion, insertion, duplication, substitution, etc. result in mutation. A mutation is the major cause of cancer. There are many mutation inducing agents (mutagens) such as UV rays
There are two types of genetic mutation:
Point mutation: There is a substitution in the single base pair of DNA, e.g. in the sickle cell anaemia. The 6th codon of the gene coding for the 𝛃-globin chain of haemoglobin changes from GAG to GUG, resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid by Valine.
Frameshift mutation: It results from the insertion or deletion of one or more pairs of bases in DNA. it changes the reading frame of triplet codons, that code for certain amino acids of the protein.
Genetic Disorders
There are many disorders in the human being that are inherited and caused due to mutation in the gene or alteration in chromosomes.

Pedigree Analysis helps in determining the risk of getting a genetic disorder in the offsprings by studying the inheritance pattern of a particular trait present in various generations of an individual.

Genetic disorders can be grouped into two types:

1. Mendelian Disorders

These are disorders due to alteration in the single gene
It follows the same inheritance pattern, as per Mendel’s law
Pedigree analysis can help trace the inheritance pattern and also determine if the trait is dominant or recessive
Mendelian Disorders
Name	Genetic Trait	Cause	Effects	Inheritance pattern
Colour blindness	X-linked recessive	Defect in the green or red cone of the eye	Unable to discriminate between red and green colour	A daughter will be colour blind only if the father is colour blind
There is a 50 percent probability of a carrier female to transfer the disease to sons

Haemophilia	X-linked recessive	Defect in one protein involved in the clotting of blood	Continuous bleeding from wounds	A daughter will be colour blind only if the father is colour blind
There is a 50 percent probability of a carrier female to transfer the disease to sons

Sickle cell anaemia	Autosome-linked recessive	A single point mutation in the beta-globin chain of haemoglobin	Anaemia	Offsprings may get the disease when both the parents are a carrier (heterozygote)
Thalassemia	Autosome-linked recessive	Mutation in the genes HBA1 and HBA2 present on the chromosome 16	Formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecule resulting in anaemia	Offsprings may get the disease when both the parents are a carrier (heterozygote)
Phenylketonuria	Autosome-linked recessive	Lack of an enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine	Mental retardation. Accumulation and excretion of phenylalanine and its derivatives in urine	Offsprings may get the disease when both the parents are a carrier (heterozygote)
2. Chromosomal Disorders

These are disorders due to excess, absence or abnormal arrangement of chromosomes
Chromosomal disorders are of two types:
(i) Aneuploidy- Gain or loss of one or more chromosomes. It is due to failure of segregation of chromatids during anaphase of meiosis
(ii) Polyploidy- It is often found in plants. This happens due to an increase in the full set of chromosomes. Failure of cytokinesis results in polyploidy
Some examples of chromosomal disorders:
Down’s syndrome- Trisomy of chromosome 21. Symptoms include mental retardation, short stature, furrowed tongue, partially opened mouth
Klinefelter’s syndrome- Total 47 chromosomes with one extra X chromosome, i.e. XXY, They are sterile, tall, overall masculine with feminine characteristics such as breast development (gynecomastia)
Turner’s syndrome- Total 45 chromosomes. One X chromosome is missing, i.e. XO. females are sterile, short stature and under-developed sexual characters","(3) Millets : Hybrid maize (Ganga-3), Jowar (CO-12) and Bajra (Niphad) : High yielding and resistant to water stress.",,,,
,,,4. Molecular Basis of Inheritance,"The DNA and RNA World:
1. Over the years after Mendel, the nature of the genetic material was investigated, resulting in the realisation that DNA is the genetic material in majority of organisms.
2. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the two types of nucleic acid found in living systems. Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.
3. DNA acts as a genetic material in most organisms, whereas RNA acts as a genetic material in some viruses.
4. RNA mostly functions as messenger. RNA has other functions as adapter, structural or as a catalytic molecule.
5. Structure of Polynucleotide Chain
(i) A nucleotide has three parts, i.e. a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA) and a phosphate group.
(ii) Nitrogenous bases are purines, i.e. adenine, guanine and pyrimidines, i.e. cytosine, uracil and thymine.
(iii) Cytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and thymine is present in DNA. Uracil is present in RNA at the place of thymine.
(iv) A nitrogenous base is linked to the pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic linkage to form a nucleoside, i.e. adenosine and guanosine, etc.
(v) When a phosphate group is linked to 5′ —OH of a nucleoside through phosphodiester linkage, a corresponding nucleotide is formed.
(vi) Two nucleotides are linked through 3′ -> 5′ phosphodiester linkage to form a dinucleotide.
(vii) Several nucleotides can be joined to form a polynucleotide chain.
(viii) The backbone in a polynucleotide chain is formed due to sugar and phosphates.
(ix) The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from the backbone.
(x) The base pairs are complementary to each other.
6. In case of RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional—OH group present at 2-position in the ribose. Also, the uracil is found at the place of thymine (5-methyl uracil).

7. Discoveries Related to Structure of DNA
(i) Friedrich Meischer in 1869, first identified DNA as an acidic substance present in the nucleus and named it as ‘nuclein’.
(ii) James Watson and Francis Crick, proposed a very simple double helix model for the structure of DNA in 1953 based on X-ray diffraction data.
(iii) Erwin Chargaff proposed that for a double-stranded DNA, the ratios between adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine are constant and equals to one.
8. Salient Features of Double-helix Structure of DNA
(i) DNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides. It is made up of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate and the bases project inside.
(ii) The two chains have anti-parallel polarity, i.e. 5′ > 3′ for one, 3′ > 5′ for another.
(iii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond (H—bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa. Guanine bonds with cytosine by three H—bonds. Due to this, purine always comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This forms a uniform distance between the two strands.
(iv) The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch of the helix is 3.4 nm and there are roughly 10 bp in each turn. Due to this, the distance between a base pair in a helix is about 0.34 nm.
(v) The plane of one base pair stacks over the other in double helix. This confers stability to the helical structure in addition to H—bonds.
9. The length of a DNA double helix is about 2.2 meters (6.6 x 109 bp x 0.34 x 10-9 m/bp)
Therefore, it needs special packaging in a cell.
(i) In prokaryotic cells (which do not have a defined nucleus), such as E.coli, DNA (being negatively charged) is held with some proteins (that have positive charges) in a region called as nucleoid. The DNA in nucleoid is organised in large loops held by proteins.
(ii) In eukaryotes, there is a set of positively charged proteins called histones that are rich in basic amino acid residues, lysines and arginines (both positive).
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-2
Histones are organised to form a unit of eight molecules called histone octamer. The negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer to form a structure called nucleosome.
(iii) A typical nucleosome contains 200 bp of DNA helix.
Nucleosomes constitute the repeating unit of a structure in nucleus called chromatin (thread-like stained structure). Under electron microscope, the nucleosomes in chromatin can be seen as beads-on-string. This structure in chromatin is packaged to form chromatin fibres that further coils and condense to form chromosomes at metaphase stage.
(iv) The packaging of chromatin at higher level requires additional set of proteins which are collectively called Non-Histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins.
molecular-basis-of-inheritance-cbse-notes-for-class-12-biology-3
(v) In a nucleus, some regions of chromatin are loosely packed (stains light) called euchromatin (transcriptionally active chromatin). In some regions, chromatin is densely packed (stains dark) called heterochromatin (inactive chromatin).
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-3
10. Transfonning Principle
(i) Frederick Griffith (1928) carried out a series of experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium causing pneumonia).
(ii) According to him, when the bacteria are grown on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S), while others produce rough (R) colonies.
(iii) This is because the S-strain bacteria have a mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R-strain does not.
(iv) Mice infected with S-strain (virulent) die from pneumonia but mice infected with R-strain do not develop pneumonia.
(v) Griffith killed bacteria by heating and observed that heat-killed S-strain bacteria injected into mice did not kill them. On injecting mixture of heat-killed S and live R bacteria, the mice died. He recovered living S-bacteria from dead mice.
(vi) From this experiment, he concluded that the ‘R-strain bacteria’ had been transformed by the heat-killed S-strain bacteria. Some transforming principle transferred from heat-killed S-strain, had enabled the R-strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent. This must be due to transfer of the genetic material.
11. Biochemical Nature of Transforming Principle
(i) Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, worked to determine the biochemical nature of transforming principle in Griffith’s experiment.
(ii) They purified biochemicals (proteins, RNA and DNA, etc) from heat-killed S-cells and discovered that DNA alone from S-bacteria caused R-bacteria to be transformed.
(iii) They also discovered that protease (protein digesting enzyme) and RNAases (RNA-digesting enzymes) did not affect transformation.
(iv) Digestion with DNAse did inhibit transformation, indicating that DNA caused transformation.
(v) They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material. But, still all the biologists were not convinced.
12. DNA is the Genetic Material
(i) Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952) gave unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material.
(ii) In their experiments, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) were used.
(iii) They grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and some others on sulphur containing radioactive medium.
(iv) Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains phosphorus but protein does not. In the same way, viruses grown on radioactive sulphur contained radioactive protein, but not radioactive DNA because DNA does not contain sulphur.
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-4
(v) Radioactive phages were allowed to attach to E. coli bacteria. As the infection proceeded, viral coats were removed from the bacteria by agitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the bacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge.
(vi) Bacteria which were infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA were radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from the virus to the bacteria.
(vii) Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicated that the proteins did not enter the bacteria from viruses. It proved that DNA is a genetic material that is passed from virus to bacteria.
13. Properties of Genetic Material
(i) It became establised that DNA is the genetic material from the Hershey-Chase experiment.
(ii) In some viruses, RNA was also reported as genetic material, e.g. Tobacco mosaic viruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.
(iii) Characteristics of a Genetic Material
(a) It should be able to replicate.
(b) It should be chemically and structurally stable.
(c) It should provide scope for slow changes (mutation) that are required for evolution.
(d) It should be able to express itself in the form of ‘Mendelian characters’.
(iv) According to the above mentioned rules, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have the ability to direct duplications.
Stability can be explained in DNA as the two strands being complementary if separated by heating come together in appropriate conditions.
(v) The 2′ — OH group present at every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and easily degradable, hence it is reactive.
(vi) DNA is chemically less reactive and structurally more stable when compared to RNA. Thymine also confers additional stability to DNA. So, among the two nucleic acids, the DNA is a predominant genetic material.
(vii) Both RNA and DNA are able to mutate. Viruses having RNA genome and having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster.
(viii) DNA is dependent on RNA for protein synthesis, while RNA can directly code for it. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA. This concluded that the DNA being more stable is suitable for storage of genetic information, while for the transmission of genetic information, RNA is suitable.
14. Francis Crick proposed the central dogma in molecular biology, which states that the
genetic information flows from
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-5
15. Replication Scheme for replication of DNA termed as semiconservative DNA replication was proposed by Watson and Crick (1953). According to it,
(i) The two strands would separate and act as a template for the synthesis of new
complementary strands. .
(ii) After replication, each DNA molecule would have one parental and one newly synthesised strand.
16. Experimental proof that DNA replicates semiconservatively, comes first from E. coli and later from higher organisms, such as plants and human cells.
Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed the following experiments to prove this in 1958.
(i) E. coli was grown in a medium containing 15NH4C1 as the only nitrogen source for many generations. 15N got incorporated into newly synthesised DNA (and other nitrogen containing compounds). This heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal DNA by centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient.
(ii) They then transferred the cells into a medium with normal 14NH4Cl and took samples at various definite intervals as the cells multiplied and extracted the DNA that remained as double stranded helices. DNA samples were separated independently on CsCl gradients to measure DNA densities.
(iii) The DNA that was extracted from the culture, one generation (after 20 min) after the transfer from 15 N to 14N medium had a hybrid or intermediate density. DNA extracted from the culture after another generation (after 40 min) was composed of equal amounts of this hybrid DNA and of light DNA.
(iv) Very similar experiments were carried out by Taylor and Colleagues on Vicia faba (faba beans) using radioactive thymidine and the same results, i.e. DNA replicates semiconservatively, were obtained as in earlier experiments.
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-6
17. DNA replication machinery and enzymes process of replication requires a set of catalysts (enzymes).
(i) The main enzyme is DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the polymerisation of deoxynucleotides. The average rate of polymerisation by these enzymes is approximately 2000 bp/second.
(ii) These polymerases has to catalyse the reaction with high degree of accuracy because any mistake during replication would result into mutations.
DNA polymerisation is an energy demanding process, so deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes, i.e. act as substrates and provide energy for polymerisation reaction.
(iv) Many additional enzymes are also required in addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.
(v) (a) Replication in DNA strand occurs within a small opening of the DNA helix, known as replication fork.
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-7
(b) DNA-dependent DNA polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, i.e. 5′ -> 3. It creates additional complications at the replicating fork. Consequently, on one strand (template 3′-5′), the replication is continuous, while on the other strand (template 5′-3′), it is discontinuous. The discontinuously synthesised fragments called Okazaki fragments are later joined by DNA ligase.
18. Origin of Replication
(i) DNA polymerases cannot initiate the process of replication on their own. Also, replication does not initiate randomly at any place in DNA. So, there is a definite region in E.coli DNA where the replication originates. The region is termed as origin of replication.
(ii) Due to this requirement, a piece of DNA, if needed to be propagated during recombinant DNA procedures, requires a vector. The vectors provide the origin of replication.
19. RNA world RNA was the first genetic material. There are evidences to prove that essential life processes, such as metabolism, translation, splicing, etc., have evolved around RNA.
(i) There are some important biochemical reactions in living systems that are catalysed by RNA catalysts and not by protein enzyne.
(ii) DNA has evolved from RNA with chemical modifications that make it more stable because RNA being a catalyst was reactive and hence, unstable.
20. There are following three types of RNAs:
(i) mRNA (messenger RNA) provides the template for transcription.
(ii) tRNA (transfer RNA) brings amino acids and reads the genetic code.
(iii) rRNA (ribosomal RNA) plays structural and catalytic role during translation.
All the three RNAs are needed to synthesise a protein in a cell.
21. Traription is the process of copying genetic information from one strand of the i DNJS. into RNA. The principle of complementarity governs the process of
transcription, except the adenosine now forms base pair with uracil instead of l thymine.
(i) In transcription, only a segment of DNA is duplicated and on Iv one of the strands is . copied into RNA. Both the strands are not copied because
• If both the strands code for RNA, two different RNA me’ ^cules and two different proteins would be formed, hence complicating the genetic information transfer machinery.
• Since two RNA produced would be complementary to each other, they would form a double-stranded RNA without translation, making the process of transcription futile.
(ii) A transcription unit in DNA is defined by three regions in the DNA which are as follows:
(a) A promoter (b) The structural gene (c) A terminator
(iii) The two strands of DNA have opposite polarity and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase also catalyse the polymerisation in only one direction that is 5′ -» 3′.
(iv) The strand that has the polarity 3′-» 5′ acts as a template and is referred to as template strand. The other strand which has the polarity (5′ -> 3′) and the sequence same as RNA (T at the place of U) is displaced during transcription. This strand is called as coding strand.
(v) The promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a transcription unit.
(vi) The promoter is located towards 5′ end (upstream) of the structural gene.
(vii) It is the DNA sequence that provides binding site for RNA polymerase and the presence of promoter defines the template and coding strands. By switching its position with terminator, the definition of coding and template strands could be reversed.
(viii) The terminator is located towards 3f-end (downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the process of transcription.
(ix) There are additional regulatory sequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the promoter.
Transcription Unit and the Gene
(i) A gene can be defined as the functional unit of inheritance.
(ii) A cistron is a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide.
(iii) The structural gene in a transcription unit could be said as monodstronic (mostly in eukaryotes) or polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes).
(iv) The coding sequences or expressed sequences are defined as exons. Exons appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by introns.
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-8
(v) Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or processed RNA.
(vi) Sometimes, the regulatory sequences are loosely defined as regulate 5: even
though these sequences do not code for any RNA or protein.
22. Transcription in prokaryotes occur in the following steps:
(i) A single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyses the transcription of all types of RNA in bacteria.
(ii) RNA polymerase binds to promotor and initiates transcription (initiation).
(iii) It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of complementarity.
It also facilitates opening of the helix and continues elongation.
(v) Once the polymerase reaches the terminator region, the nascent RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in termination of transcription.
(vi) RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the process of elongation.
It associates transiently with initiation-factor (a) and terminator factor (b), to initiate and terminate the transcription, respectively. Thus, catalysing all the three steps.
(vii) Since, the mRNA does not require any processing to become active and also since transcription and translation take place in the same compartment, many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully transcribed. As a result, transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria.
23. Transcription in eukaryotes have additional complexities than prokaryotes.
(i) There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus other than the RNA polymerase in organelles. The RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNAs (28S, 18S and 5.8S). RNA polymerase III is responsible for transcription of fRNA, 5srRNA and SnRNAs (small nuclear RNAs). RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the heterogenous nuclear RNA (/mRNA).
(ii) Another complexity is that, the primary transcripts contain both the exons and the introns and are non-functional. Hence, subject to a process called splicing. In this process, introns are removed and exons are joined in a definite order.
(iii) /mRNA undergoes additional processing called as capping and tailing. In capping, an unusual nucleotide is added to the 5′-end of /mRNA. In tailing, adenylate residues
(200-300) are added at 3′-end in a template. It is the fully processed /mRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the nucleus for translation process.
Molecular Basis of Inheritance - CBSE Notes for Class 12 Biology img-9
Significance of these complexities are:
(i) The split gene arrangements represent an ancient feature of genome.
(ii) The presence of introns is reminescent of antiquity.
(iii) The process of splicing represents the dominance of RNA world.",,,,,
,,,5. Origin and Evolution of Life,"In its most common usage, the word “evolution” refers to the process of biological change that takes place over time in living things. On the other hand, planets, stars, galaxies, and even the universe itself can be seen to “evolve,” which is an example of a different kind of evolution throughout thousands of years. Time changes every one of these situations, as seen by their various processes. After millions of years, the earth became sustainable for life, and that’s the time origin and evolution of life began on the planet. There are five theories on the origin of life.

The History of Earth
This article is about the history of how the earth has changed from the beginning to the present. The process of accretion from the sun’s core led to the formation of earth approximately 4.54 billion years ago, roughly one-third of the area of the universe. Outgassing from volcanoes most probably made the primitive human atmosphere, followed by the ocean. However, the primitive atmosphere contained almost no oxygen.

Four great aeons make up the history of the earth, which began 4,540 million years ago when the planet formed. Earth’s composition, climate, and life on the planet have undergone dramatic shifts throughout each era. Each aeon is then split into eras, which would, in turn, are divided into periods, which are further divided into epochs.

The Origin of Life on Earth 
The origin of life on earth is the subject of numerous hypotheses. The earth was thought to have formed 5 billion years ago, but it wasn’t until another billion years later that life on the planet began to emerge. Many scientists studied fossils and conducted experiments to develop their versions of the theory of evolution, which has since been widely accepted.

Theories of the Origin of Life on Earth
Life was once thought to have been a gift from God, who created the world and everything. They believed that this was a result of God’s creation and an act. Although, there was no proof to support the claims. Earth was thought to have been created elsewhere by ancient Greeks and other early scientists, not on earth itself. These scientists termed this phenomenon ” panspermia ” because they believed it had come from another part of the cosmos.

Theory of Spontaneous Generation
According to Aristotle, hay, straw, and other inorganic matter were the primary source of life. During his time, the theory of spontaneous generation of life was born. According to Aristotle, organic matter decays and rots to produce life. The first scientist to disprove this theory was Louis Pasteur. According to this theory, the origin and evolution of life is by inorganic matters.

The Theory of Chemical Evolution of Life
Oparin and Haldane, two scientists from Russia and England, came up with the ‘chemical evolution of life’ theory. According to their theories, amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids such as RNA formed the basis for life’s emergence through a gradual chemical reaction. This occurred as a result of the combination of non-living and living materials. They postulated that these organic materials came together under conditions favourable to the emergence of simple life forms, such as high temperatures, a decreasing atmosphere (depleted of oxygen), and gases released from volcanoes. They thus referred to this mixture of organic compounds as “organic soup.”According to this theory origin and evolution of life by the chemical component

Miller- Urey Experiment
Oparin and Haldane’s theory needed to be validated, and Miller and Urey were two scientists working to do so. There was a faith in it, and they were convinced it was accurate. Hence the “Miller-Urey experiment” was carried out in the laboratory.

Using gases such as methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapour, they simulated the early earth’s climate in their laboratory and recreated the conditions that may have existed there. In this way, they could replicate the early earth’s climate conditions.

A week later, they checked the results of their experiment and discovered sugar, amino acids, nitrogen bases, and fats.

Previous theories held that chemical evolution produced polymeric units from monomeric units. This led to the emergence of unicellular microorganisms, and it also gave rise to multicellular species with increasingly sophisticated functions. Biogenesis is a term for this process.
Classical Theories
A few historical ideas which gained acceptability in their times are :

Theory of Eternity : Hutton believed that “life on earth is there from the beginning and was neither created nor will be destroyed.
Theory of Special Creation : Religious beliefs – life is a divine creation, not changeable (Father Suarez, 1548–1617 in Bible)
Theory of Spontaneous Generation (or abiogenesis) : Life arise spontaneously from lifeless matter, e.g., frog, fishes from mud; lice from sweat; maggot from decaying meat/fish; insect from plant juice, microorganism from air/water.
Proponents : Thales, Empedocles, Anaximander, Xenophanes, Plato, Aristotle.
Van Helmont (1642) claimed rat to arise from sweat-soaked dirty clothes if kept in dark bran-house for 20 days with wheat grains.

Francesco Redi (1621–1697); Spallanzani (1729–1799) tried to disprove this theory experimentally but their plea were rejected by people like Leeuwenhoeck, Buffon, Huxley, Newton & others

Louis Pasteur (1862) finally disproved it by his experiment of “Swan necked flask”; in sterilized sugar syrup the microorganisms could grow only when polluted air (with spores) passed into it.

Theory of Biogenesis :
Founded upon the conclusion of Louis Pasteur (1862) – “Life originates from pre-existing life” (or “Omnis vivum ex vivo”) Harvey (1651), T.H. Huxley (1870) supported it.

Cosmozoic theory or Extraterrestrial theory or Theory of Panspermia:

Richter (1865) Helmholtz (1884) Arrhenius (1808), Hoyle (1950) believed in eternity of life, which came on earth in sperm or spores like form, from cosmos or other planet

But it seems illogical as life can not survive while passing through cold, dry and radiating space.

Theory of catastrophism (or cataclysmus) :

G. Cuvier (1800), father of paleontology.Aristotle believed hierarchial increase of complexity as shown in “scala naturae”, e.g. non living plants sponge animals; once formed organism start reproducing like themselves

Lucretius, a Roman philosopher believed in gradual change in living being similar to Greek thoughts.Empedocles was called “Father of concept of evolution” by Osborn (1896). Buffon (1707-1788), the father of modern concept of evolution was the first serious naturalist to talk about “evolving living forms”. Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), the grand father of Charles Darwin, proposed about “species changing by modification” in his book Zoonomia on evolution.

Theory of Terrestrial or Abiogenic Origin:
Life arose by series of “sequential chemical reaction” from nonliving (inorganic) matter. There is general consensus of scientific opinions hence also called as Modern Theory or Scientific hypothesis or the Naturalistic Theory or Theory of chemical origin. Charles Darwin (1857), Joseph Hooker, A.I. Oparin (1923) and J.B.S. Haldane (1929) supported it Oparin named it as materialistic theory in his book, Origin of Life (1938).

Oparin–Haldane Theory:
A.I. oparin (1923) a Russian and J.B.S. Haldane (1929) a British said that first life originated from nonliving things at some point of time in very long past when conditions on earth would have been very different. Hence it was first by abiogenesis and then biogenesis ever since. Primitive earth had no oxygen (in free gaseous form) but only as bound in water and some metallic oxides on surface of rocks, hence it was reducing atmosphere.The sequence of change, an 8-step process, begins right from the formation of earth.

Theories of Origin of Life

Ist Step :

The hot (5000–6000ºC) rotating clouds of atoms got condensed and segregated in 3 concentric layers due to rotational and gravitational forces and gradual lowering of temperature. The heaviest metallic atoms like Fe, Ni, Cu, Au, Ag etc. came in the centre to form core (hot boiling), the next heavy elements like Ca, Mn, Na, K, Si, Al, S & P deposited around the core as shell and lightest like C, O, H, N etc. remained in outermost layer to form the gaseous atmosphere.

2nd Step :

Atoms coming closer formed molecules, the outer layer got solidified while inner core remained boiling which used to erupt as volcanoes at times; the hot lava combined with C & N of atmosphere and formed carbides and nitrides appearing as rocks (lithosphere). H2 being most numerous combined with all O2 to form water molecules (initially as vapour). Similarly NH3, CO2, CO were also formed. With further decrease in temperature, water drops began forming, resulted in rains → further cooling of earth surface → resulted in stay of water on earth surface → covered with water (hydrosphere) containing chlorides and phosphates formed by erosion of rocks.

3rd Step :

Interaction of chemicals in atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere led to formation of various organic molecules, and energy for this came from heat, lightening, radiation (cosmic rays), gravitational forces etc.
Conclusion
That’s all about our discussion on the evolution of the earth, followed by the origin and evolution of life. The origin and evolution of life began on the planet. It is thought that the earth formed 5 billion years ago, but the emergence of life on the earth took another billion years. Many scientists studied fossils and conducted experiments to develop their theories of evolution. Organic matter decays and rots, according to Aristotle, to produce life. Louis Pasteur, a scientist, first disproved this theory. The Miller-Urey experiment in the lab supported the ‘chemical evolution of life’ theory of Oparin and Haldane.",8.

Best solvent for various solutes.
Inert inorganic compound.
Neutral pH (i.e. pH = 7) of pure water.
High specific heat.
High heat of vaporization.
High heat of fusion.
2. Due to these properties water is best transporting medium, best medium for biochemical reactions and acts as a thermal buffer.
3. Hydrogen bonding occurs in liquid water which is mainly responsible for these properties.
4. Good adhesive and cohesive forces exist in water molecule.
5. Owing to high surface tension and these forces, it can rise in capillaries.
6. Water is a molecule that connects or is a link between physical factors and biological processes.

Water absorbing organ-

1. Root system – Chief organ of water and mineral absorption.
2. Terrestrial plants absorb liquid water from soil with root hairs while epiphytes like orchids, have special hygroscopic tissue velamen that absorbs water vapour from atmosphere.
3. Regions of root – four zones.
Root cap is situated at tip behind it is

zone of meristematic region
zone of elongation
zone of absorption or root hair zone and
zone of maturation.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 1
4. In zone of absorption, thin, delicate, unicellular hair like extensions i.e. root hairs develop from epidermal cells.
5. Structure of root hair : It is cytoplasmic extension, tube like, colourless, unbranched and short lived (ephemeral) structure.
6. Root hair has large central vacuole, thin cytoplasm, plasma membrane and double layered wall of pectin and cellulose.
7. Freely permeable cell wall while selectively permeable plasma membrane.

Water available to roots for absorption-

1. Rhizosphere : Microenvironment surrounding the root, constitutes rhizosphere from which plants absorb water.
2. Soil is the main source of water for plants.
3. Water present in soil is in following forms namely :

Gravitational water percolated deep in soil due to gravity.
Hygroscopic water held tightly around soil particles, adsorbed or adhered water on fine particles.
Combined water present as hydrated oxides of silicon, aluminium, etc.
Capillary water present in the fine spaces or capillaries between soil particles.
4. Plants readily absorb capillary water from soil.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation

Absorption of water by roots from soil-
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 2

When water is absorbed by plant, all the three physical processes occur simultaneously at root hair.

1. Imbibition :

Swelling up of hydrophilic colloidal substances.
Water is adsorbed on the surface.
Imbibant : Substance that adsorbs.
Imbibate : Substance that gets imbibed.
In root hair double layered cell wall of cellulose and pectin is imbibant.
Water is tightly adsorbed on the surface till the equilibrium is reached.
2. Diffusion :

Movement of ions/atoms/molecules of a substance from region of high concentration to that of their low concentration.
Movement results due to kinetic energy.
It takes place till equilibrium is reached.
In root cell, diffusion occurs through freely permeable cell wall.
Diffusion pressure created is directly proportional to number of diffusion particles.
Pure water has more diffusion pressure (D.E) than solvent in solution.
Diffusion results in diffusion pressure. D.ED. can be considered as thirst of cell, capacity which absorbs water from surrounding of adjacent cell.
D.ED. (Diffusion Fressure Deficit = S.E (Suction Fressure)
Difference in D.E of pure solvent (i.e. water) and solvent in solution is termed D.ED.
D.ED. is capacity to absorb water from surrounding.
Cell sap has less D.E than water around cell wall. Thus, water diffuses inside.
It is significant in absorption of water and minerals, transport of food, exchange of gases and conduction of water upwards against gravity.
3. Osmosis :

 A process by which water actually enters root hair (cell interior).
Special type of diffusion.
Involves movement of solvent through a semipermeable membrane.
Cell sap inside the cell is concentrated (minerals, sugars) while solution outside cell is weaker. Hence solvent (water) from outside enters the cell passing through semipermeable plasma membrane.
In root cell, at interphase of cell wall and plasma membrane, water enters by osmosis.
Type of solutions based on concentration
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 3
Two types of osmosis
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 4
Turgor pressure (T.P.) : Pressure exerted by turgid cell sap on cell membrane and cell wall.
Fully turgid cell has D.ED. = 0 (zero)
Wall pressure (W.P.) : Cell wall exerts pressure on inner cell sap i.e. counterpressure. Hence T.P = W.P but it is in opposite direction.
Osmotic pressure (O.P.) : Pressure exerted due to osmosis so as to stop entry of water (solvent) inside.
Pressure of solution in opposite direction.
To check entry of water (solvent molecules) inside cell.
D.RD. (thirst of cell) demand or ability to gain water by cell = O.P – T.P and T.P = W.P
∴ D.ED. = O.P – W.P (Osmotic pressure minus wall pressure)
In flaccid cell T.P is 0 (zero) . .D.RD. = O.E In turgid cell D.PD. is 0 (zero) ..T.R = O.R
Facilitated diffusion :

Passive absorption of solutes (no expenditure of energy)
Takes place with the help of carriers (special proteins – porins)
Diffusion through cell membrane
Lipid soluble components can easily pass but hydrophilic components need carrier.
Requirement of concentration gradient for diffusion.
Membrane proteins – aquaporins and ion channels are sites of facilitated diffusion.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation

Water potential ( Ψ )-

Free energy is needed to do the work and for movement of water, i.e. osmosis )
Chemical potential : Free energy per molecule in a chemical system.
Water potential : It is chemical potential of water – Unit bars / pascal (pa) / atmosphere D.RD. is now termed as water potential.
Water potential of protoplasm is opposite in sign but equal to D.RD. i.e. negative value.
Pure water has water potential zero. When some solute is added there is decrease in water potential (t//) i.e. negative.
Flow of water is from less negative potential to more negative potential, i.e. from higher water potential to lower.
In adjacent cells, plasmodesmata connections are concerned with movement of water.
Factors affecting water absorption :

Types of water-presence of capillary water.
Soil temperature-favourable range 20 to 30°C.
Concentration of solutes in soil water – High solute concentration reduces rate of absorption.
Soil aeration : If soil aeration is less then there is absorption.
Rate of transpiration : With increase in transpiration, there is increase in absorption of water.
Plasmolysis-

1. Exosmosis that occurs in living cells upon placing in hypertonic (concentrated) solution is termed plasmolysis.

Shrinkage of protoplasm
Separation from cell wall forms a gap between cell wall
Flaccid nature due to removal of water.
2. Turgor pressure (T.R) is zero in plasmolysed cell.
3. Deplasmolysis : When flaccid cell is kept in hypotonic solution endoosmosis takes place and thus it becomes turgid.
4. In fully turgid cell T.R = O.P and D.RD. is zero, (no absorption of water by cell)

Path of water across the root (i.e. from epiblema up to xylem in the stelar region)-

1. Root hair cell : Absorption of water takes place from rhizosphere by process of imbibition then diffusion and finally osmosis.

2. In turgid cells (root hair) due to absorption of water → Increased turgor pressure (T.P) and lowered D.PD. →adjacent cell (Cortical cell) → more D.PD. more osmotic pressure (O.R) → adjacent cell will take water from turgid root ha.i → root hair cell thus becomes flaccid → absorb water from soil.

3. A gradient of D.PD. or suction pressure (S.R) is formed from root epidermis till the region of cortical cells.

4. Movement of water is from root hair → epidermis → loosely arranged cortical cell → passage cells of endodermis → pericycle → protoxylem

5. Due to continuous absorption of water hydrostatic pressure is developed, i.e. root pressure → Helps in transfer and conduction further in xylem of root.

6. The movement of water from root hair to xylem takes place along two different pathways, viz. apoplast pathway and symplast pathway.

7. Pathway for water across roots:
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 5

8. Additional apoplast pathway :

Direct pathway leading to xylem.
Secondary roots originate at pericycle inside endodermis.
Bypass endodermis having Casparian strip. Hence allow direct entry in vascular system.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation

9. In normal apoplast pathway, suberised layer forces shift to symplast in order to enter xylem.

10. Symplast pathway is transmembrane pathway through plasmodesmatal connections in living cells of cortex. The plasmodesmata interconnect the cytoplasm of cells forming cytoplasmic network called symplast.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 6

Learn this as well :

Vacuoles in the root cells are interconnected to form intercellular connections.
Intervacuolar connections are formed between the cells.
Cytoplasmic connections are towards the periphery of cell.
Tonoplast, the membrane of vacuole is differentially permeable membrane which allows the passage of certain solutes but not all along with solvent.
Mechanism of absorption of water-

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 7

Translocation of water-

1. Ascent of sap : Transport of water along with dissolved minerals from root to aerial part against gravity is called translocation or ascent of sap.
2. Ascent of sap occurs through lumen of xylem tracheids and vessels. Physical forces and activity of living cells is required for ascent of sap. Complex tissue xylem as a path of water is proved by ringing experiment.
3. Root pressure theory (Vital theory) by J. Pristley :

Living cells of root are responsible for translocation of water.
Xylem sap exuding out from cut end of stem above the soil indicates existence of root pressure.
As water is absorbed by root hair constantly and continuously, hydrostatic pressure is set in root cortical cells.
Owing to this root pressure, water with dissolved minerals is pushed into xylem and also conducted upwards.
Root pressure is an osmotic phenomenon, develops due to absorption of water.
Oxygen, moisture, temperature and salt content of soil affect root pressure, Root pressure of +1 to +2 bars is sufficient to carry water upwards to 10 to 20 metres.
Objection to this theory :

Not applicable to tall plants.
Ascent of sap occurs even if root system is absent.
Some tall plants have zero root pressure (Gymnosperms).
Root pressure is absent in actively transpiring plants.
Xylem sap shows negative hydrostatic pressure as it is under tension in normal condition.
4. Capillarity theory (Physical force theory) By Bohem :

Physical forces and dead cells (xylem with lignified wall) are responsible for translocation.
Water is raised to certain level due to capillarity.
Capillarity is due to surface tension, cohesive and adhesive forces of water.
Water conducting elements have lignified walls and are with lumen (xylem vessels and tracheids)
Combined cohesive forces of water and adhesive forces of water with xylem wall form continuous water column.
Owing to capillarity, water is conducted upwards against gravity.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation

Objection to capillarity theory :

Continuous capillary tube is essential but tracheids have thickened, tapering closed end walls.
Lower end of capillary tube not in direct contact with soil water.
Tall trees show wide lumen in xylem vessels. Narrower the capillary tube, higher level of water column is raised.
5. Cohesion – Tension theory (Transpiration pull theory) By Dixon and Joly :

Widely accepted theory of ascent of sap.
Based on cohesion and adhesion with transpiration pull developed.
Strong force of attraction of water molecules : Cohesive force
Strong force of attraction of water molecules and lignified walls of xylem : Adhesive force
Water loss is in the form of water vapour, mainly through stomata is transpiration.
Owing to combined action of cohesive and adhesive forces, a continuous water column is maintained through xylem.
Transpiration pull developed due to water loss in leaf vessels is transmitted downwards towards root.
Water lost from stomata causes increased D.RD. of mesophyll cells which in turn takes water from xylem of leaf.
A gradient of suction pressure or D.ED. is set in, due to transpiration, which causes tension or pull. Owing to this, water column is pulled upwards through xylem.
It is passive pull of water against gravity which results in ascent of sap.
Objections to transpiration pull theory :

Formation of gas bubbles due to temperature fluctuations may not keep water column continuous.
Vessels as tabular structure are much evolved and efficient in conduction but this theory assumes trachieds are more efficient.
If transpiration is checked due to some artificial means like application of Vaseline, then also ascent of sap occurs, (clogging of stomata due to application of Vaseline)
Ascent of sap occurs in plants which are deciduous, (leaf fall)
Transport of mineral ions-

Minerals are elements which play an important role in vital processes in metabolism. Thus they are essential elements for plants.
Elements required in large amount, Macro elements : e.g. N, P C, H, O, etc.
Elements are required in small amount, Micro elements : e.g. B, Cu, Mn, Co, etc.
Soil is a chief source of minerals and they are absorbed in dissolved (ionic) form through root system.
Minerals are absorbed by plants from their surrounding environment (atmosphere – C, H, O) and soil (inorganic materials).
Absorption of minerals is independent of that of water.
Minerals are transported with ascent of sap. Hence root is source and they get lodged at the required organ.
Unloading of the transported material is by diffusion from veins and cells uptake them.
Minerals can be remobilized inside plant body from older leaves to young leaves, e.g. R S, N, K, etc. But those parts of structural framework are not disturbed, e.g. Ca.
Nitrogen in inorganic ion form and amino acids, amides in organic form are transported through xylem.
Some exchange of material takes place between xylem and phloem.
Transport of food-

Food is synthesised in chloroplast containing cells.
Part of plant where food is synthesised is source (leaf) and where it is utilized is sink e.g. root.
Translocation of food occurs from source to sink through phloem. The movement or transport of food from one part to other part is called translocation of food.
Sieve tubes (phloem) and vessels (xylem) are ideal for vertical or longitudinal transport. Sieve tubes for downward transport.
The lateral or horizontal translocation occurs through medullary rays (parenchyma) from phloem to pith or cortex.
Food is translocated in soluble form sucrose along concentration gradient set from sink.
Vertical translocation – (longitudinal transport)
From leaves i.e. source to sink (root) in downward direction or growing point (stem) and seed germination, corm, bulbil germination in upward manner.
Lateral translocation – occurs in root and stem.
Radial translocation from phloem to pith.
Tangential translocation from phloem to cortex.
Phloem transport is bidirectional. Phloem sap has sucrose, and water with other sugar, amino acids and hormones.
Mechanism of sugar transport through phloem – Mass Flow hypothesis or Munch’s Pressure flow theory is – most widely accepted concept.
Other theories are diffusion, activated diffusion, electro osmosis, protoplasmic streaming.
Ernst Munch theory : Glucose synthesised in photosynthesis which increases osmotic concentration of photosynthetic cell → Endo osmosis → water absorbed from adjacent cells and xylem → Turgidity of cell →Increased turgor pressure → sugar from photosynthetic cell forced into sieve tube → This is vein loading.
Root cell (sink) → utilization of sugar → polymerisation of sugar to starch → osmotic concentration lowered. Exosmosis → hence water lost to adjacent cells → decrease in turgidity → Turgor pressure lowered → Turgor pressure gradient is set → Translocation of food passively along concentration gradient → This is vein unloading.
Sugar is used at the sink or stored and excess water transported to xylem.
Objections of theory –

Bidirectional flow is not explained.
Pressure flow is a physical process.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation

Transpiration-

From the constant absorption of water 5% is utilized and 95% surplus water is lost through aerial parts in the form of mainly water vapour.
Guttation : Loss of water in liquid form (1%), occurs from water stomata or hydathode.
Transpiration : Water lost in the form of water vapour mainly foliar transpiration.
Types of Transpiration
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 8
Structure of stomatal apparatus-

Stomatal apparatus has guard cells, stoma and accessory cells.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 6 Plant Water Relation 9
The elliptical pores (opening – stoma) are bounded by two guard cells, either kidney shaped or dumbbell shaped cells.
Guard cells are modified epidermal cells, nucleated cells with uneven thick wall – Inner wall thick and inelastic, outer wall is thin and elastic, with chloroplasts.
Accessory cells/Subsidiary cells –
Specialized epidermal cells that surround guard cells. They are reservoir of K+ ions.
Opening and closing of stomata Is controlled by turgidity of guard cells.
During daytime → Thrgld guard cells due to endoosmosls → ExertIon of T.P on outer thin wall → elastic wall stretch out → Thick walls pulled apart → stoma opens.
During night-time → flaccid guard cells due to exosmosis → outer elastic wall relaxes → Inner thick walls pushed → stoma closes.
Diurnal changes In osmotic potential are responsible for flaccidity and turgidity of guard cells.
As per starch-sugar hypothesis → DurIng day time starch gets converted to sugar by enzyme phosphorylase → Increase osmotic potential → entry of water
Reverse reaction during night → stoma close
As per proton pump theory — Transport of H+ and K+ ions

During daytime – starch converted to malic acid → dissociation into malate and protons (H+) → H+ in subsidiary cells → K+ ions from subsidiary cells to guard cells → open stomata Potassium malate → Increase osmotic potential → endoosmosis (turgidity)
At night → uptake of K+ and Cl– ions is checked by abscissic acid – change In permeability, osmotic potential → Hypotonic guard cells → exosmosis → flaccid → stoma close
Advantages of Transpiration:

Removal of excess water
Helps In absorption of water
Cooling effect
Helps in gaseous exchange
Maintains turgor of cells
Ascent of sap
Disadvantage – Excessive transpiration causes wilting injury and that may lead to death of plant.

Transpiration : A necessary evil – (By Curtis)

During daytime stomata remain open thus help in gaseous exchange – for respiration and photosynthesis
Productivity is adversely affected if stomata remain closed
When stomata are open transpiration cannot be avoided.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 4
Growth rate is low in lag phase, faster growth rate reaching maximum in exponential or log phase and is gradually slows down in stationary phase. –
Sigmoid curve is obtained when rate of growth plotted against time for all three phases.
Grand period of growth (GPG) : The total period required for all phases (Lag, log and stationary) to occur is called grand period of growth.
Differentiation, De-differentiation, Re-differentiation-

1. Differentiation : It is the permanent change in structure and function of cells leading to maturation.

Maturation of cells derived from apical meristems.
Major anatomical and physiological changes occur.
2. De-differentiation : It is a process or ability where living differentiated cells regain the capacity to divide thus permanent cells become meristematic. e.g. Cork cambium, Parenchyma cells forming interfascicular cambium for secondary growth.

3. Re-differentiation : The de-differentiated cells lose their capacity to divide and mature for the specific function, e.g. Secondary xylem and secondary phloem formed from de-differentiated cambium.

Development-

It is an orderly process of progressive changes in shape, its form and also complexity.
In plant it includes all sequential events in its life cycle, viz. – Seed germination → Meristem → Cell division → Plasmatic growth → Cell elongation → Cell maturation → Mature cell → Senescence → Death
Thus growth, morphogenesis, maturation and senescence are included in development.
Plasticity-

Plasticity : It is capacity of being moulded or modelled.
In plants, plasticity is ability to form different types of structures in response to external environmental stimuli or internal stimuli. (Intrinsic plasticity)
Plasticity is noticed in various phases of life. e.g. different form’s of leaves in same plant – cotton, coriander, larkspur (Delphinium) i.e. heterophylly in juvenile and adult stage.
Environmental Plasicity is observed in Butter cup (Ranunculus Flabellasis).
Heterophylly where aquatic habitat has dissected leaves and in terrestrial habitat broadly lobed leaves.
Growth Hormones-

Growth Harmones:
Growth promoters	Growth inhibitors	Growth regulators
Auxins
Gibberellins (GA)
Cytokinins (CK)	Ethylene

In short day plants, flowering is not observed if dark period is interrupted by brief exposure to red light of 660 nm but if it is exposed immediately to far red light of 730 nm flowering is observed.
Proteinaceous pigments present in leaves.
Exist in two interconvertible forms Pr and Pfr.
Pfr absorbs far red light and it is changed to Pr and when Pr absorbs red light it is changed to Pfr (biologically active form).
Phytochromes are situated in cell membrane of chlorophyllous cells of leaves.
12. During day time Pfr accumulates in leaves and stimulates flowering in LDP but inhibits flowering in SDP
13. During night (dark) Pfr converted to Pr ‘and stimulate flowering in SDP but inhibits flowering in LDP
14. In plants, morphogenesis is controlled by both light and phytochromes and hence it is known as photomorphogenesis.
15. Photoperiodic stimulus is chemical stimulus called florigen which is hormonal in nature and is transported through phloem.

Vernalization-

It is influence of low temperature on flowering in plants. The term vernalization was coined by Lysenko.
Temperature influences several physiological processes and reproductory growth i.e. flowering.
Klippart observed low temperature or chilling treatment is responsible for stimulus of early flowering.
The seeds or seedlings are exposed to low temperatures of 1 – 6° C for about a month’s duration.
The shoot apical meristem receives stimulus in seedlings.
Effective in seed stage (embryo) for annual plants. Cereals and crucifers show response to low temperature pretreatments.
The stimulus is in the form of chemical substance which is proved by grafting experiment by Melcher. It is Vernalin.
Devernalization : It is reversal of vernalization by high temperature treatment.
Advantages:

Crops can be produced earlier.
Cultivation of crop possible where they do not occur naturally.
Mineral Nutrition-

1. Minerals are required by plants for synthesis of food material, i.e. inorganic substances are raw materials.
2. Soil is chief source : Solid, inorganic materials are obtained from earth’s crust.
3. Air and water are other sources from surroundings.
4. Minerals are absorbed in dissolved form usually through roots.
5. Sources of minerals :

Atmosphere : Carbon as Carbon dioxide, Oxygen
Water : Hydrogen, Oxygen
6. C, H, O are non-mineral major elements, structural components.
7. Classification of minerals – Based on need

Essential
Non-Essential
Essential

Without these life cycle of plants cannot be completed.
Important structural and functional (physiological role)
Their unavailability causes major deficiency symptoms. e.g. C,H,O,N,R
Non-Essential

Not indispensable for completion of life cycle.
Do not produce or cause major deficiency.
Needed only at specific time during growth. E.g. Bo, SI, Al
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition

8. Classification based on requirement – quantity

Mac roelements
Microelements
Mac roelements:

Major elements
Required in bulk or in large amounts
Important role in nutrition
 Structural componcnts
e.g. CalcIum — Ca (cell vall)
e.g. C, H. O. R N, K, Mg. S.
Microelements:

Minor elements
Required in traces or small amounts
Role as cofactors
Act as Catalysts, activators
e.g. Zn, Cu, Al, SI, Mn, B.
9. Recent classification is based on their functional role, i.e. on the basis of biochemical functions.
10. Symptoms of Mineral deficiency in plants :
Any visible deviation from the normal structure and function of plant is called symptom.
11. Critical concentration : Required amount or the concentration of essential element below which plant growth is retarded or affected is called critical concentration.
12. Indication of deficiency is in the form of morphological changes. It may be related to the mobility of the element in the plant body.

13. Important symptoms visible in plants :
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 8

14. Role of Mineral Elements in Plants :
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 9
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 10

15. Toxicity of Micronutrients :
Condition of toxicity : When dry weight of tissues is reduced by 10% due to mineral ion concentration it is considered as toxic to plant.

16. Uptake of one element may be affected or inhibited by toxicity of other. For e.g. Mn competes with Fe and Mg for uptake by root system and inhibits translocation of Ca to shoot apex. It leads to deficiency of Ca, Mg and Fe.

17. Mineral salt absorption : In soil minerals exist as charged particles and mineral absorption is independent of water absorption.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition

18. Methods of Mineral absorption

Passive absorption
Active absorption
Passive absorption

No expenditure of energy
By diffusion
Direct or indirect ion exchange
Mass flow
Donnan equilibrium
Active absorption:

ExpendIture of energy
Move against concentration gradient
ATP energy from respiration
Accumulation of ions in root hair
19. Donnan equilibrium : Some anions after their entry inside the cell get accumulated on inner side of cell membrane.

20. Additional cations are needed to balance these accumulated anions, thus the cation concentration becomes more as they get accumulated.

21. This transport from exterior against their own concentration gradient for either cations or anions is Donnan equilibrium, which is for neutralizing the effect of accumulated cations/ anions.

22. Active absorption : It needs ATP energy which is supplied to roots from respiration. Hence when there is scarcity of oxygen available to roots there is less absorption of minerals.

23. Mineral ions accumulated in root hair reach xylem through cortical cells and further along with water carried upwards.

24. They are assimilated in organic molecules and carried further with phloem to other parts i.e. redistribution.

25. A carrier concept, where membrane proteins of root cell membrane may pump these ions into cytoplasm is suggested.

Nitrogen Cycle –

The cyclic movement of nitrogen between atmosphere, biosphere (organisms) and soil in natural processes is a nitrogen cycle.
Nitrogen available to plants from the environment is inert and they need it in reactive form mainly nitrate ions to utilize in synthetic processes.
Nitrogen is a limiting element which affects productivity.
Through biological and physical fixation it is made available to plants.
Nitrogen fixation : Conversion of free nitrogen into nitrogenous salts to make it available to plants is called nitrogen fixation.
Nitrogen Fixation-
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 11
Physical nitrogen fixation – Atmosphere
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 12

Industrial nitrogen fixation : Haber – Bosch process
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 13

Urea is less toxic and it is used as fertilizer.
About 80% of nitrogen found in human tissues originate from Haber-Bosch process.
Biological nitrogen fixation :

High energy requiring process
To fix each molecule of nitrogen to ammonia need is 16 ATE
Ammonia is toxic it is converted to amino acids -> Proteins
Nitrification : e.g. different soil bacteria – aerobic forms – Chemoautotrophs

Two step process
Ammonia converted to nitrogen dioxide (nitrite) HNOa by Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus.
Nitrite converted to Nitrate by addition of oxygen by bacteria Nitrobacter.
Symbiotic N2 fixation : e.g. Root nodules of Fabaceae plants – Pea, Bean, Gram, Groundnut have Rhizobium bacteria in it. Rhizobium also seen in soil.

Ammonification : e.g. Decomposers – Fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes
After death and decay of living organisms, ammonia is made available to plants and other microbes.

Nitrogen assimilation :

Soil reservoir has nitrogen in nitrate, nitrite and ammonia (NH4–) i.e. ammonium ion.
Uptake of these available forms from soil by plants converts and incorporates them in amino acids, nucleic acids (DNA) like organic compounds – This is assimilation.
In the form of biomolecules Nitrogen moves through food chain and then to decomposers.
Amino acids are transported to different parts for synthesis of required proteins.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition

Amino acid synthesis

Reductive aminatlon
Transamination
Reductive aminatlon:

E.g. Ammonia reacting with a Ketoglutaric acid to form glutamic acid.
Reduction reaction
Transamination:

Glutamic acid reacting with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) to form Aspartic acid.
Reduction reaction 2. Transfer of amino group to other Carboxylic acid
Amidation : Process of formation of amides.

Amino acids may incorporate ammonia to produce amides. Thus these are amino acids with two amino groups.
In presence of ATP extra amino group is attached to acidic (-COOH) group.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 7 Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition 14
Amides are transported via xylem vessels.
Denitrification : e.g. Anaerobic bacteria.

Soil nitrates are converted to nitrogen gas.
Denitrifying bacteria thus return back nitrogen from ecosystem to atmosphere.
2NO3 → 2NO2 2NO → N2↑
Nitrate → Nitrous oxide → Nitric oxide → Nitrogen gas
e.g. Bacillus spp, Paracoccus spp, Pseudomonas denitrificans.
Sedimentation : Nitrates of soil are washed away with running water or leached deep with percolating water. Thus they get accumulated and remain in the form of sediments locked and away from free circulation.",Its objective is to develop varieties that are resistant to plant pathogens.,,,,
,,,8. Respiration and Circulation,"Respiration-

Respiration is a biochemical process of oxidation of organic compounds in an orderly manner for the liberation of chemical energy in the form of ATP
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + 38ATP
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Organs of respiratory exchange-

1. Respiratory surface should possess the following features for efficient gaseous exchange.

A large surface area.
Thin, highly vascular and permeable to allow exchange of gases.
Moist surfaces.
2. A terrestrial plant has stomata on leaves and young stems and lenticels on the stem surface for exchange of gases.

3. In animals, depending upon the complexity of organization and the surrounding medium, respiratory organs have become specialized and are usually associated with a transport system.

4. Respiratory organs In different organisms:

Organism	Respiratory surface or organ
I. Aquatic organisms
(1) Protists, sponges, coelenterates	Plasma membrane
(2) Planaria, Annelids, Amphibians	Plasma membrane, general body surface and moist skin

III. Underwater organism
Turtle	* Cloaca
Learn this as well :
Only at the time of diving or when underwater, turtles perform cloacal respiration. There are a pair of accessory air bladders connected to the cloaca which can absorb oxygen from the water.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Human respiratory system-

Human respiratory system consists of nostrils, nasal chambers, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, aided by diaphragm and intercostal muscles.

1. Nostrils and nasal chambers :

(1) The nostrils are external openings of the nose. Oxygen rich air is taken into the body through the nostrils or external nares. Carbon dioxide and water vapour are released out of the body through the nostrils.

(2) The internal nares open into the pharynx. The space between the external and internal nares is known as nasal chamber. The nasal chamber is lined internally by mucous membrane and ciliated epithelium.

(3) The nasal chamber is divided into right and left parts by a cartilage called mesethmoid. Every nasal chamber is further divided into three regions, viz. vestibule, respiratory part and sensory part.

Vestibule : The anteriormost part of the nasal chamber is vestibule. Hair present in this chamber prevent the dust particles from going inside.
Respiratory part : It is the part which is richly supplied by capillaries. Air is made warm and moist in this region.
Sensory part : The sensory epithelium lines this region. It is concerned with the detection of smell.
2. Pharynx :

The pharynx is a short, vertical tube about 12 cm in length. The respiratory and food passages cross each other in the pharynx.
The upper part of the pharynx is known as naso-pharynx. It conducts the air.
The lower part is called laryngo-pharynx or oro-pharynx. It conducts food to the oesophagus.
The tonsils are present in the pharynx. They are made of lymphatic tissue. They kill the bacteria that are trapped in mucus.
3. Larynx :

The larynx produces sound. In males, it increases in size at puberty. This is termed as Adam’s apple.
From the pharynx air enters the larynx. The opening through which it enters is called glottis.
The glottis has a guarding flap called epiglottis.
The epiglottis prevents the entry of food particles into the trachea.
The vocal cords are seen along the side of the glottis. They are made of elastic tissue. They produce sound.
Passage of air between the vocal cords and modulations created by tongue, teeth, lips and nasal cavity produce voice.
4. Trachea :

The trachea or windpipe is about 10-12 cm long and 2.5 cm wide.
It is situated in front of the oesophagus and runs downwards in the thorax.
Fibrous muscular tissue supported by ‘C’ shaped cartilages form the walls of the trachea.
16 to 20 cartilage rings are present in the trachea.
The trachea is lined internally by ciliated epithelium and mucous glands.
Mucous and ciliary action remove the dust particles and push them upwards to the larynx. These particles are then gulped and taken into the oesophagus. Instant coughing can remove foreign particles that enter the trachea.
5. Bronchi and bronchioles :

The trachea divides into two bronchi (singular- bronchus) at its distal end behind the sternum.
The bronchus has complete ring of cartilage for support.
The bronchi enter the lungs on either side.
After entering the lungs each bronchus divides into secondary and tertiary bronchi. The tertiary bronchi divide further to form bronchioles.
The bronchioles are minute and are without the cartilage rings in their walls.
Each bronchiole ends into a bunch of alveoli which appear like a bunch of grapes. Each alveolus is balloon shaped.
Many alveoli make the lung spongy and elastic.
6. Lungs :

The lungs are principal respiratory organs located in the thoracic cavity.
They are pinkish, soft, hollow, paired, elastic and distensible organs.
The lung is enclosed in a pleural sac.
The pleural sac has two membranes – an outer parietal and an inner visceral which enclose the pleural cavity.
The pleural fluid which is present in the pleural cavity lubricates and prevents friction when pleural membranes slide on each other.
The lungs are richly supplied with blood capillaries and hence are highly vascular organs.
The left lung has two lobes while the right lung has three lobes.
Each lobe has many bronchioles and alveolar sacs.
The alveolar sacs are spherical and thin walled and contain about 20 alveoli.
The alveoli are covered by a network of capillaries from pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein.
Each alveolus has thin and elastic wall. It is about 0.1 mm in diameter.
The alveolar wall is 0.0001 mm thick and is made of simple, non-ciliated, squamous epithelium. It has collagen and elastin fibres.
Every lung has about 700 million alveoli which increase the surface area for the exchange of gases.
The outermost covering of the lungs which is known as visceral pleura is made of smooth muscle fibres.
The lobule in the lung consists of alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs and alveoli. In alveoli gaseous exchange takes place.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Mechanism of respiration –

1. The process of respiration includes breathing, external respiration, internal respiration and cellular respiration.

(A) Breathing :

Breathing is the process by which the air comes in and goes out of the lungs.
The rate of gaseous exchange is speeded up by breathing.
Breathing is a part of respiration and the terms breathing and respiration are not synonymous.
Inspiration and expiration together make breathing.
(i) Inspiration :

Inspiration is an active process brought about by ribs, intercostal muscles, sternum and diaphragm.
The intercostal muscles contract and pull the ribs outwards. This increases the space in the thoracic cavity. The lower part of sternum is simultaneously raised. The diaphragm contracts and flattens. This
causes further increase in the volume of : thoracic cavity.
Pressure in the lungs decreases and the volume | increases due to expansion of the lungs.
Due to pressure difference the atmospheric * air rushes into the lungs through respiratory * passage as a result of which air is inspired * in.
(ii) Expiration :

Expiration is the passive process.
During expiration the intercostal muscles j relax and the ribs are pulled inwards.
The diaphragm is relaxed and becomes ; dome-shaped.
The volume of the thoracic cavity is reduced. :
The pressure on the lungs is increased as a j result of which they get compressed.
Air is thus expelled out of lungs through the j nares.
(iii) Respiratory cycle :

Respiratory cycle is alternate inspiration and expiration process.
In adult man there are 16 to 20 respiratory cycles per minute.
The medulla oblongata in the brain controls the respiration.
(B) External respiration/exchange of gases at the alveolar level :

Exchange of gases between the alveolar .air and the blood takes place through thin squamous epithelial layer of alveolus and similar layer of the capillary wall.
Respiratory gases will always diffuse from an area of higher partial pressure to an area of lower partied pressure in these two regions.
Due to difference in partial pressure, carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveolus whereas oxygen will diffuse from alveoli to the capillaries.
Table : Pulmonary volumes and capacities :
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation 1
(C) Internal respiration :

Transport of O2 : Only 3% of total oxygen is carried in a dissolved state by plasma while 97% of oxygen is carried in the form of oxyhaemoglobin from lungs to tissues.
Oxygen dissociation curve : A sigmoid curve which shows oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation and the relationship between oxyhaemoglobin saturation and oxygen tension.
Bohr effect : The shift of oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve due to change in partial pressure of C02 in blood is called Bohr effect.
Haldane effect : The effect caused by increase in hydrogen ions which results in decrease of pH of blood is called Haldane effect.
Transport of CO2 :

7% of COa is transported in the form of carbonic acid by plasma.
70% of COa is transported from tissues to lungs in the form of sodium bicarbonate and potassium.
Remaining 23% of COa is carried in the form of carbaminohaemoglobin.
Hamburger’s phenomena or chloride shift : Movement of chloride ions to maintain the ionic balance between the RBCs and the plasma is called chloride shift.
(D) Cellular respiration : In this last step food is oxidized in the cell and ATP is produced and used to carry out vital processes.

2. Carbon monoxide poisoning :

Haemoglobin has affinity for oxygen. But for carbon monoxide it has about 250 times more affinity than that of oxygen.
With carbon monoxide it forms a stable compound called carboxyhaemoglobin.
Due to such combination, the oxygen is not transported to the tissues. The tissues thus suffer from oxygen starvation. This leads to asphyxiation and in extreme cases death.
Treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning is given by administering oxygen-carbon dioxide mixture to make high PO2 level to dissociate the carbon monoxide from haemoglobin.
Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs in closed rooms with open stoves, gas burners, automobile engines or any incomplete combustion.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Regulation of breathing-

Normal breathing is an involuntary process controlled by inspiratory centres and expiratory centres in medulla, pneumotaxic centre in pons and apneustic centre located in medulla.
The Hering-Breuer reflex controls the rate and depth of breathing and also prevents over inflation of lungs.
Cerebral cortex has voluntary centres which prevent water or irritating gases from entering the lungs.
Modified respiratory movements-‘

Modified respiratory movements are used to express emotions and to clear air passages. They may be reflexes or voluntarily initiated movements such as yawning.

Common disorders of respiratory system-

1. Respiratory disorders:

Respiratory disorders	Cause and symptoms
(1) Emphysema	Cause : Cigarette smoking and air pollution
Symptoms : Over inflation of the alveoli, rupture of alveolar wall.
(2) Bronchitis	Cause : Certain bacterial or viral infection, also caused by smoking and air pollution.

(7) Occupational respiratory disorders silicosis, asbestosis	Cause : Long term exposure to silica and asbestos dust in the mining industry.
Symptoms : Irritation, fibrosis causing inflammation.
2. Treatment of respiratory disorders is by taking suitable antibiotics, inhalants, vaporizers and cough medicines. Also quitting smoking, using preventive masks and staying away from polluted air is too remedy against these disorders.

3. Artificial ventilation : Method of induced breathing in a person who is unable to breathe is given artificial ventilation.

4. Ventilator : A machine supporting breathing when normal breathing fails.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Transportation in living organisms-
Circulation in animals-

1. Transportation by diffusion and active transport is suitable in extremely small organisms.

2. Intracellular transport by cyclosis is shown by almost all living organisms e.g. Paramoecium, Amoeba, root hair cells of many plants and WBCs in animals.

3. Extracellular transport : In this transport water or body fluid is circulated through body cavities as in sponges and coelenterates or moved around the viscera by contraction of body wall and muscles as in roundworms or parenchymal circulation, viz. flatworms.

4. Blood vascular system in higher animals from Annelida to chordate contains

blood as a circulating fluid,
heart as a pumping organ and
the blood vessels through which blood circulates.
5. Types of blood vascular system :

(1) Open circulation :

In this type, blood finally conies out of the blood vessels and is circulated through the body cavities (haemocoel).
Blood flows at low pressure and there is direct exchange of materials between blood and cells or tissues of the body.
Respiratory pigment is usually absent. When present, it is dissolved in plasma of the blood, e.g. Arthropods and Molluscs.
(2) Closed circulation :

In this type of circulation, blood is circulated all over the body through the network of blood vessels.
Blood does not come in direct contact with cells and body tissues and the exchange of materials between the blood and cell takes place through an intermediate fluid called lymph.
Blood flows through blood vessels at high pressure and can be regulated. Respiratory pigment like haemoglobin is present for transportation of respiratory gases, e.g. All vertebrates, higher molluscs and annelids.
Closed circulation can be of two main types : single circulation and double circulation.
(a) Single circulation : In fishes heart shows single circulation as blood passes only once through heart during one cardiac cycle.
(b) Double circulation :

Human heart shows double circulation as blood passes twice through the heart during one cardiac cycle. The blood follows two routes, viz. pulmonary and systemic.
Pulmonary circulation is the circulation between the heart and the lungs. The course of blood during pulmonary circulation is from the right ventricle (by pulmonary trunk) to the left atrium (by two pairs of pulmonary veins) of heart through lungs.
Systemic circulation is the circulation between the heart and the body organs (except lungs). The course of blood during systemic circulation is from left ventricle (by systemic aorta) to all body organs and from the body back to right atrium (by vena cavae).
Learn This As Well:
Coronary circulation is circulation to the cardiac muscles of the heart. Coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood whereas coronary veins join to form coronary sinus and collect deoxygenated blood. This sinus opens into the right atrium.

Circulatory System in Human-

1. Circulatory system in human is made up of blood vascular system and lymphatic system.
2. Blood vascular system consists of blood, heart and blood vessels.
3. Blood composition and Coagulation :

Study of blood is called haematology.
The bright red, slightly alkaline main circulating, fluid in the human body is blood.
Blood is a fluid connective tissue derived from mesoderm. It has pH about 7.4.
There are about 5 litres of blood in the body which is about 8% of the total body weight.
Composition of blood : There are two main components of blood, viz., plasma (55%) and blood corpuscles (45%).
(i) Plasma : Plasma is a straw coloured fluid part of blood, slightly alkaline, viscous fluid consisting of 90 – 92% water and 8 – 10% of solutes.

Solutes are 7% proteins (serum albumin, serum globulin, heparin, fibrinogen and prothrombin).
Other solutes are nutrients (glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol).
Nitrogenous wastes such as urea, uric acid, ammonia and creatinine.
Gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
Regulatory substances like enzymes and hormones.
Inorganic substances like bicarbonates, chlorides, phosphates and sulphates of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc.
(ii) Blood corpuscles : Blood corpuscles are of three types, viz. erythrocytes (RBCs), leucocytes (WBCs) and thrombocytes (platelets).

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Red blood corpuscles/erythrocytes-

Circular, biconcave, enucleated cells of about 7 /im in diameter and 2.5 /mi in thickness.
RBC count is about 5.1 to 5.8 million RBCs/ cu mm in male and 4.3 to 5.2 million/cu mm in female. The average life span of RBC is about 120 days.
Erythropoiesis is formation of RBCs. It occurs in liver and spleen in foetus and in red bone marrow in adults.
The old RBCs are destroyed in liver and spleen.
Polycythemia is increase while erythrocytopenia is decrease in number of RBCs.
RBCs contain respiratory pigment called haemoglobin which helps in transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
The normal haemoglobin content in adult male is 14-17 gm/100 ml of blood and 13-15 gm/100 ml of blood in adult female.
Less amount of haemoglobin leads to anaemia.
RBCs transport oxygen from lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs. They maintain blood pH as haemoglobin acts as a buffer. They also maintain the viscosity of the blood.
RBCs also contains an enzyme, carbonic anhydrase.
The haematocrit is the ratio of the volume of RBCs to total blood volume of blood. Its value is different in men and women.
White blood corpuscles/Leucocytes-

Leucocytes are colourless, nucleated, amoeboid and phagocytic cells.
They show diapedesis, i.e. squeezing out of blood capillaries by amoeboid movement.
The size is about 8 to 15 fxm.
Total WBC count is 5000 to 11000 WBCs/ cu mm of blood.
The average life span of WBCs is about 3 to 4 days.
Leucopoiesis or formation of WBCs. It occurs in red bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus and Payer’s patches.
Leucocytosis is increase while leucopenia is decrease in the number of WBCs.
Leukaemia or blood cancer is a pathological increase in number of WBCs.
The dead WBCs are destroyed by phagocytosis in blood, liver and lymph nodes.
Leucocytes are of two types, viz., granulocytes and agranulocytes.
Granulocytes are of three types, viz. neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils.
Agranulocytes are of two types, viz. monocytes and lymphocytes.
Characteristics of different types of leucocytes
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation 2
Thrombocytes/Platelets-

Thrombocytes are smallest, non-nucleated, round and biconvex. They are of about 2.5 to 5 m in diameter. Their count is about 2.5 – 4.5 lakhs/cu mm.
Their life span is about 5 to 10 days.
Megakaryocytes of bone marrow form thrombocytes.
Thrombopoiesis is the formation of platelets.
Thrombocytosis is the increase while thrombocytopenia is the decrease in platelet count.
Thrombocytes help in coagulation of blood by releasing thromboplastin.
Blood clotting/coagulation of blood : Active anticoagulants like heparin and antithrombin are present in the intact blood vessels. But upon the rupture of a blood vessel, bleeding starts. The fluid blood is converted into semisolid jelly by the process of blood coagulation or clotting.”
The clotting of blood is a complicated process in which many factors (12 clotting factors) present in plasma and tissues are involved.

The event that take place during blood clotting are as follows :

Release of thromboplastin from extrinsic source in tissue and intrinsic source in plasma at injured site through a step-wise (cascade process) process.
Formation of enzyme prothrombinase in the blood.
Conversion of prothrombin into thrombin by prothrombinase.
Conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin by thrombin.
Formation of mesh by the fibrin fibres forming the clot.
The normal clotting time is 2 to 8 minutes.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Heart-

1. Heart is a hollow, muscular, conical organ about the size of one’s fist with broad base and narrow apex tilted towards the left.
2. It is mesodermal in origin.
3. It is situated in middle of the thoracic cavity in a space called mediastinum, between the two lungs.
4. The heart is 12 cm in length, 9 cm in breadth and 250 to 300 grams in weight.
5. Pericardium : Double layered membrane, these layers are as follows :

Fibrous pericardium : Outer, tough layer of inelastic fibrous connective tissue.
Serous pericardium : This inner pericardium has two layers, outer parietal layer and inner visceral layer.
Parietal layer forms the inner lining of fibrous pericardium.
Visceral layer or epicardium is next to heart on the outer side.
Pericardial fluid is present between the parietal and visceral layers of serous pericardium.
6. Heart wall :

The heart wall has three layers, viz. outer epicardium, middle myocardium and inner endocardium.
Epicardium has single layer of flat epithelial cells called mesothelium.
Myocardium has cardiac muscle fibres responsible for movements of the heart.
Endocardium has single layer of flat epithelial cells called endothelium.
7. External structure of heart :

Human heart consists of two superior, small, thin walled receiving chambers called atria or auricles and two inferior, large, thick walled, distributing chambers called ventricles.
Atrio-ventricular groove or coronary sulcus, a transverse groove which is present between the atria and the ventricles is seen externally.
The interventricular sulcus is present between the right and left ventricles. Coronary arteries and coronary veins are present in the sulci. The coronary veins join to form coronary sinus which opens into the right atrium.
The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from all over the body through superior vena cava and inferior vena cava.
Left atrium receives oxygenated blood from lungs through two pairs of pulmonary veins.
From the right ventricle deoxygenated blood is sent to lungs through pulmonary trunk.
From the left ventricle oxygenated blood is sent to entire body by systemic aorta.
Ligamentum arteriosum connects the pulmonary trunk and systemic aorta. It represents ductus arteriosus of foetus.
8. Internal structure of heart :

There are four chambers in the heart, viz., two atria and two ventricles which can be demarcated internally.
Atria are thin walled upper receiving chambers separated from each other by interatrial septum.
The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from all over the body through superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and from the heart through coronary sinus.
The opening of inferior vena cava is guarded by Eustachian valve while the opening of coronary sinus is guarded by Thebesian valve.
The fossa ovalis is oval depression that is present on the right side of interatrial septum. It is the remnant of foramen ovale, an oval opening in the interatrial septum of the foetus.
The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs through four openings of pulmonary veins.
Right and left atria open into the right and left ventricles respectively through atrioventricular apertures. These are respectively guarded by tricuspid and bicuspid valves made up of connective tissue.
The right atrioventricular valve has three flaps hence called tricuspid valve while left atrioventricular valve has two flaps hence called bicuspid valve or mitral valve.
These valves are attached to papillary muscles of ventricles by chordae tendinae. The valves are prevented from turning back into the atria during the contraction of ventricles due to chordae tendinae.
Ventricles are two thick walled lower, distributing chambers separated from each other by interventricular septum.
Left ventricle has thick wall. The inner surface of the ventricle is thrown into a series of irregular muscular ridges called columnae carnae or trabeculae carnae.
Pulmonary trunk or aorta arises from the right ventricle carrying deoxygenated blood to lungs for oxygenation. Systemic aorta arises from the left ventricle carrying oxygenated blood to all parts of the body.
Pulmonary aorta and systemic aorta have three semilunar valves at the base which prevent the backward flow of blood during ventricular diastole.
9. Pumping action of heart : Heartbeat is the rhythmic contraction, i.e. rhythmic contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) of the heart. The rate of heartbeat is about 72 times per minute during which it pumps out about 5 litres of blood which equals cardiac output.

10. Conducting system of heart :

The heartbeat in human beings originates in modified cardiac muscles called sinoatrial node (S.A. node). Therefore, the heart is said to be myogenic.
The conducting system of heart consists of sinoatrial node (SAN), atrioventricular node (AVN), Bundle of His and Purkinje fibres.
The heart shows auto-rhythmicity as the impulse for its rhythmic movement during beating is developed inside the heart.
The autorhythmic fibres are developed during embryonic life. They act as pacemaker by setting the rhythm for the heart. They also form conducting system for conducting impulses throughout heart muscles.
The impulse travels in the heart in the following manner : Sinoatrial node (Pacemaker) → Internodal pathway → Atrioventricular node → Bundle of His → Right and left bundle branches → Purkinje fibres.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

Working mechanism of human heart-

1. Cardiac cycle : One atrial systole (0.1 second), one ventricular systole (0.3 second), followed by a joint diastole (0.4 second) is called a cardiac cycle. One cardiac cycle takes place in about 0.8 second and is also called a heartbeat.

(1) Atrial systole : During atrial systole, the deoxygenated blood from the right atrium enters the right ventricle through atrioventricular aperture whereas the oxygenated blood from left atrium enters the left ventricle through atrioventricular aperture. In normal conditions atrial systole lasts for 0.1 second and atrial diastole lasts for 0. 7 second.

(2) Ventricular systole : During ventricular systole, the deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle enters the pulmonary trunk and the oxygenated blood from the left ventricle enters the aorta. The backflow of blood into atria is prevented by the closure of cuspid valves of both atrioventricular apertures (lubb sound is produced) Ventricular systole lasts for 0.3 second and ventricular diastole lasts for 0.5 second.

(3) Joint diastole or complete diastole : Both atria and ventricles undergo relaxation. During ventricular diastole the backflow of blood from pulmonary trunk and systemic aorta into respective ventricles is prevented by closure of semilunar valves (dub sound is produced). The joint diastole lasts for 0.4 second.

2. Regulation of cardiac activity :

Cardiovascular centre present in the medulla oblongata of brain regulates the working of the heart.
Sympathetic nerves secrete adrenaline, which increases the rate of the heart.
Parasympathetic nerves secrete acetylcholine, which decreases the rate of the heart.
Conditions like hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis decrease cardiac activity whereas hormones like epinephrine and nor epinephrine increase cardiac activity (chemical control).
Elevated level of K+ and Na+ decreases cardiac activity.
Blood vessels-

1. Blood vessels are of three types, viz. arteries, veins and capillaries.

Arteries : Blood vessels carrying blood away from the heart are called arteries. Arteries form arterioles which in turn divide and re¬divide to form capillaries.
Veins : Blood vessels carrying blood to the heart are called veins. They have broad lumen and show low blood pressure.
Capillaries : Capillaries are thinnest of blood vessels and formed by division and redivision of arteriole. Capillaries unite to form venules. Venules join to form veins.
2. A chart showing the differences between arteries, veins and blood capillaries :
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation 3

Angiology is the study of blood vessels.

3. Heartbeat, pulse and cardiac output :

Heartbeat is the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart.
One systole and one diastole make one heartbeat.
Heart rate is number of beats per minute (72 times per minute).
Stroke volume is amount of blood pumped out of the ventricles each time (About 70 ml of blood).
Cardiac output is amount of blood pumped out of the ventricles per minute,
i. e 72 x 70 ml = 5040 or about 5 litres of blood per minute.
Tachycardia is faster heart rate (Over 100 beats per minute).
Bradycardia is slower heart rate (Over 60 beats per minute).
Pulse is a pressure wave travelling through the arteries after each ventricular systole.
Pulse in the radial artery at the wrist is commonly measured.
The pulse rate per minute indicates the heart rate. It is same as that of heart rate (72 per minute).
Pulse rate changes with age, sex, posture, exercise and emotional state.
Blood pressure (B.P.)-

1. Blood pressure : Arterial blood pressure is the lateral pressure or force exerted by flowing blood on the wall of arteries.
2. Sphygmomanometer is the instrument used for measuring the blood pressure.
3. The units of blood pressure are mm Hg millimetres of mercury).
4. Blood pressure is of two types-systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.

Systolic blood pressure : It is the maximum pressure of blood during ventricular systole. Normal systolic pressure is 120 mm Hg.
Diastolic blood pressure : It is the minimum pressure of blood during ventricular diastole. Normal diastolic pressure is 80 mm Hg.
The normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg.
Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure. Normal pulse pressure is 40 mm Hg.
5. Factors affecting arterial blood pressure :

Cardiac output
Peripheral resistance
Blood volume
Length and diameter of blood vessels
Viscosity of blood
Age
Gender
Venous return
Sleep, emotions
Exercise, anxiety
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 8 Respiration and Circulation

6. Hypertension :

Hypertension means higher values of blood pressure (More than 140/90 mm Hg blood pressure values).
Excessive high blood pressure of about 230/120 mm Hg may cause rupturing of blood vessels of eye (causing blindness), kidney (nephritis) and brain (stroke or paralysis).
Factors such as arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, obesity, physical , or emotional stress, alcoholism, smoking, cholesterol rich diet, increased secretion of renin, epinephrine or aldosterone, etc. can cause blood pressure.
7. Coronary artery disease (CAD) :

Atherosclerosis (narrowing of coronary arteries) can cause coronary artery disease.
In CAD the heart muscle is damaged because of an inadequate amount of blood due to obstruction of its blood supply.
Depending on the degree of obstruction symptoms may be mild chest pain (angina pectoris) or heart attack (myocardial infarction).
8. Atherosclerosis : Deposition of fatty substances in the lining of arteries, resulting in the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque. These depositions decrease the size of the arterial lumen.

9. Angina pectoris : Angina pectoris is the pain in the chest due to reduction in blood supply to cardiac muscle caused by narrowed and hardened coronary arteries.

10. Angiography : Angiography is X-ray imaging of the cardiac blood vessels to locate the position of blockages. Remedied procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery",It is carried out by hybridization process.,,,,
,,,9. Control and Coordination,"Introduction-

Plants show control and coordination by sending chemical signals and bringing about various types of movements.
Animals control and coordinate the body’s activities by electrical and chemical signals.
The nervous system and endocrine control system are two coordinating systems in them.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 9 Control and Co-ordination 1

Nervous Coordination

Nervous System in Hydra-

Hydra → diffused nervous system in the form of nerve net.
Two nerve nets in the mesoglea, one connected towards the epidermis and second towards the gastro-dermis.
Sensory cells scattered in the body wall and tentacles, but no sense organs
No sensory and motor nerves.
Nervous System in Planaria (flatworm)-

Primitive animal with a central nervous system (CNS) located on the ventral side of body.
Mass of cerebral or cephalic ganglion appearing like an inverted U-shaped brain.
Ventral pair of nerves arising from ganglia. Interconnected to each other by transverse nerve or commissure in a ladder like manner.
The peripheral nerve plexus arising laterally from VNC.
Neural tissue-

1. Two types of cells in neural tissue – the neurons and the neuroglia or glial cells.
2. Nerve is bundle of axons. Outside the CNS, it is called nerve while inside it is called tract.
3. Types of nerves : Sensory (with sensory * fibres), motor (with motor fibres) and mixed * type (with both sensory and motor fibres).
4. Neurons/Nerve cells :

Neuron is structural and functional unit of * the nervous system.
Each multipolar neuron has three parts – cyton : or cell body, dendron and axon.
5. Grey matter and white matter :

Grey matter is darker part of CNS. This is due to presence of cytons.
White matter is lighter part of CNS. This is due to presence of myelin sheaths around axons.
In PNS however, the accumulation of cyton causes a swelling on the nerve. Such a swelling is called ganglion, [cytons within CNS form nuclei while those in PNS form ganglia]

6. Connective tissue layers in a nerve are :

Endoneurium : covers each nerve fibre
Perineurium : covers each nerve bundle having a number of neurons
Epineurium : covers many nerve bundles to form a peripheral nerve
7. Neuroglial cells :

More in number than the neurons.
They are supporting cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS).

Synapse-

1. Junction between two nerve cells with a minute gap (synaptic cleft) in between them which allows transmission of impulse by a neurotransmitter bridge.
2. When the telodendria are connected to muscle fibre, it is called motor end plate or neuro¬muscular junction.
3. Properties of nerve fibres :

 Excitability/Irritability
Conductivity

4. Types of synapses : Electrical synapse and Chemical synapse.

(1) Electrical synapses are found in those places of the body requiring fastest response as in the defence reflexes.
(2) A chemical synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is called a neuromuscular junction or motor end plate.
There are three components of a typical chemical synapse.

The pre-synaptic terminal
The synaptic cleft
The post-synaptic neuron
5. Transmission of nerve impulse across a synapse :

This transmission takes place with the help of neurotransmitters.
Once the neurotransmitters bind to the receptors of the post-synaptic cell, the action is either excitatory or inhibitory depending on the type of neurotransmitter.
The enzyme like acetyl cholinesterase destroys the neurotransmitter after the transmission and the synapse is ready to receive a new impulse.
Transmission of nerve impulse along the axon-

The excitable neurons transmit the impulse through changes in electrical charges across the neuronal membrane.
The external tissue fluid has both Na+ and K+ ions.
This process is called sodium pump or Na-K exchange pump.
Generation of nerve impulse : Occurs through depolarization.
Saltatory conduction takes place in medullated nerve fibres.

Commonly called mental disorders. There is a wide range of conditions that affect the mood, thinking or behaviour.
Some of the major categories of psychological disorders are :

Intellectual disability (earlier known as mental retardation),
Autism spectrum disorder
Bipolar disorder
Depression
Anxiety disorder
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)
Stress related disorders.
2. Parkinson’s disease :

3. Alzheimer’s disease :

It is the most common form of dementia.
Its incidence increases with the age.
Symptoms include the loss of cognitive functioning- thinking, remembering, reasoning and behavioural abilities. It interferes with the person’s daily life and activities.
Chemical Coordination

Endocrine system –

1. The cells in organisms communicate with each other through chemical signals. These cells are broadly of four types as follows :

Autocrines : Cells release secretion to stimulate themselves.
Paracrines : Cells release secretion to stimulate neighbouring cells.
Endocrines : Cells release secretion to stimulate distant cells.
Pheromones : Cells/Organs release secretions to stimulate other organism.
2. Chemical coordination is carried out by secretions of ductless glands or endocrine glands. Hence this chemical coordination system is also called the endocrine system.

3. Endocrine system :

The endocrine system controls body activities by means of chemical messengers called hormones.
Hormones are released directly into the blood.
4. Properties of Hormones :

They act as chemical messengers and are effective in very low concentration.
Hormones can function as regulators that inhibit or stimulate or modify specific processes.
Hypersecretion or Hyposecretion of hormones leads to various disorders.
These are metabolised after their function and are excreted through urine.
5. Mechanism of hormone action :

Hormones are released in a very small quantity.
They produce their effect on the target organs/cells by binding to hormone receptors.
The hormone receptors may be on the cell membrane or may be intracellular.
A hormone receptor complex is formed and . this leads to biochemical change in the target tissue.
(a) Mode of hormone action through membrane receptors :

Hormones like catecholamines, peptide and polypeptide hormones are not lipid soluble. Therefore they cannot enter their target cells through plasma membrane.
Molecules of amino acid derivatives, peptide hormones bind to specific receptor molecules located on the plasma membrane.
The hormone receptor complex causes the release of an enzyme adenylate cyclase from the receptor site. This enzyme forms cyclic AMP from ATP of the cell.
The hormone acts as the first messenger and cAMP is the second messenger.
(b) Mode of hormone action through intracellular receptors :

Steroid and thyroid hormones are lipid soluble and easily pass through plasma membrane of target cell into the cytoplasm.
In the cytoplasm, they bind to specific intra¬cellular receptor proteins forming a hormone-receptor complex that enters the nucleus.
In the nucleus, the hormone receptor complex binds to a specific regulatory site of DNA.
Major endocrine glands-

1. Hypothalamus :

Ectodermal in origin.
Forms the floor of diencephalon.
Major function is to maintain homeostasis.
Controls the secretory activity of pituitary gland by the release and inhibiting hormones.
All hormones of hypothalamus are peptide hormones.
2. Hormones of hypothalamus :

Somatotropin/GHRF
Somatostatin/GHRIF
Adrenocorticotropin Releasing Hormone
Thyrotropin Releasing Factor .
Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)
Prolactin Inhibiting Hormone (Prolactostatin)
Gastrin Releasing Peptide (GRP)
Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP)
3. Pituitary gland or hypophysis :

(1) External morphology :

Pea sized reddish-grey coloured gland.
Controls almost all other endocrine glands, hence previously it was called the master endocrine gland.
However, hypothalamus controls it through the releasing and inhibiting factors.
Located just below the hypothalamus and is attached to it by a stalk called infundibulum or hypophyseal stalk.
Remains lodged in a bony depression called sella turcica of the sphenoid bone.
Consists of two lobes called anterior lobe (Adenohypophysis) and posterior lobe (Neurohypophysis). Intermediate lobe (Pars intermedia) is a small reduced part lying in the cleft between the anterior and posterior lobe.
Neurohypophysis is connected directly to the hypothalamus by axon fibres forming hypothalamo- hypophyseal tract,
Adenohypophysis and intermediate lobe are connected to the hypothalamus through hypothalamo- hypophyseal portal system.

(3) Hypothalamo – Hypophyseal portal system :

Various hormones secreted by hypothalamus reach the pituitary gland through this portal system.
The portal vein collects blood from various parts of hypothalamus and opens into anterior lobe of pituitary.
From pituitary, the vein finally carries the blood into the superior vena cava.
(4) Hormones of pituitary and their role :

4. Pineal gland :

The pineal body/pineal gland is given off from the roof of diencephalon. It is located between the two cerebral hemispheres.
The pineal gland is sensitive to the biochemical signals of light.
It secretes a hormone called melatonin also known as sleep hormone.
5. Thyroid gland :

(1) Morphology :

It is the largest endocrine gland.
The two lobes of thyroid gland are connected a non-secretory band called isthmus.
(2) Internal structure :

The thyroid lobes are composed of rounded follicles held together by interfollicular connective tissue called stroma.
The stroma contains blood capillaries and small group of parafollicular cell or ‘C’ cells.
Thyroid follicles Eire composed of cuboidal epithelium resting on a basement membrane and is filled with a gelatinous colloid.
(3) Thyroid hormones :

The two hormones secreted by the follicular cells are Thyroxine/tetra iodothyronine/T4 (four atoms of iodine) and Triiodothyronine or T3 (three atoms of iodine).
Parafollicular cells produce a hormone thyrocalcitonin whose production is not under the control of TSH.
(4) Formation of T3 and T4 :

Thyroxine is synthesized by attaching iodine to amino acid tyrosine by enzymatic action.
The amino acid tyrosine molecule binds to iodine to produce Monoiodotyronine (T1) or 2 atoms of iodine to produce Diiodothyroninc (T2).
T1 and T2 molecules bind end to end to make colloidal mass inside the follicle. They are further metabolised to prepare T3 and T4.
(5) Functions of Thyroid hormones :

Regulation of the basal metabolic rate of body.
Regulation of metabolism by stimulating protein synthesis and promotes growth of body tissues.
Calorigenic effect as it helps in thermoregulation by increasing heat production.
Increases action of neuro transmitters – adrenaline and nor adrenaline.
Supports the process of RBC production and maintenance of water and electrolyte balance.
Regulates reproductive cycles in females.
Parafollicular cells or ‘C’ cells produce thyrocalcitonin hormone, which regulates calcium metabolism.
Calcitonin is the active form of hormone, which is hypocalcemic hormone. It regulates the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in the blood.

6. Parathyroid gland :

Situated on the posterior surface of the lobes of thyroid gland.
2 pairs, named as superior and inferior parathyroid glands.
Cells are arranged in a compact mass.
(4) Hormones :

The parathyroid secretes a peptide hormone called parathormone (PTH). It is also called
Collip’s hormone.
Regulates calcium and phosphate balance between blood and other tissues. It is a hyper calcemic hormone. Release of parathormone increases blood calcium level.
It stimulates osteoclast of bones to stimulate bone resorption.
Thus, parathormone and calcitonin are antagonistic hormones.
(5) Disorders :

Hyposecretion of parathormone	Hypersecretion of parathormone
Parathyroid tetany or hypocalcaemic tetany.	Osteoporosis.
Lowers concentration of calcium in the blood. This increases excitability of nerves and muscles causing muscle twitch and spasm.	Responsible for more resorption of calcium from bones i.e., demineralization of bones resulting in softening, bending and fracture of bone.
7. Thymus gland :

(1) Located in the upper part of thorax on the dorsal side of the heart just behind sternum.
(2) Prominent gland at birth till puberty but gets gradually atrophied in the adult due to action of sex hormones.

(3) Functions:

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 10 Human Health and Diseases 6

10. Mechanism of action of B-lymphocytes to antigens :

B-lymphocytes → sensitized directly by antigens and helper T-cells.
Activated B-lymphocyte → multiplies rapidly → Clone of plasma cells and memory B-cells produced → Plasma cells produce → Glycoproteins, called antibodies → Antibodies circulated through humor/ body fluids like blood and lymph → The antibody → bind to a cell membrane or they remain free.

11. Three main functions of free antibodies :

Agglutination	Opsonisation	Neutralization
Immobilization of foreign particles in mass and then engulfing them by phagocytes.	Coating the bacteria to facilitate the phagocytosis by macrophages.	Neutralizing toxins released by bacteria.
12. Vaccination :

Vaccination : Administration of inactivated pathogen or antigenic protection of particular pathogen for protecting against a particular pathogen, is called vaccination.
Vaccine : Inactivated pathogen or antigens of a specific disease.
Vaccination is a primary prevention as it helps the body to recognize and eliminate pathogenic organism.
Disease control on mass scale is done through vaccination. E.g. Measles, polio, tetanus and whooping cough, tuberculosis, etc. are prevented through vaccination.
Structure of antibody-

1. Antibodies are highly specific glycoproteins which can neutralize specific antigens.
2. Chemically they are Immunoglobulins (Igs), produced after antigenic stimulation.
3. Production in plasma cells which are formed by B-lymphocytes.
4. Rate of production of antibodies is very rapid, i.e. about 2000 molecules/second.
5. Structure of antibody :

‘Y’-shaped molecule. Having four polypeptide chains : Two heavy or H-chains and two light or L-chains.

Hinge : This is region holding together arms and stem of antibody.
Two distinct regions : Variable region and the constant region.
Paratope : This is antigen binding site present in variable region.
Epitope : Antigen has antigenic determinant site, called epitope.
Bivalent antibodies : Antibodies having two antigen binding sites.
Serology: Study of antigen-antibody interactions.
FormatIon of antigen-antibody complex: Epitopes (On antigens) and paratopes (on antibody) react with each other. Each antibody Is specific for specific antigen due to variable regions having small variations. Specific antibody binds to specific antigen forming an antigen-antibody complex.
Antigen on Blood Cells: Antigens (A, B, D) on the surface of human red blood cells : responsible for different blood groups.
 Blood group systems : ABO, Rh. Duffy, Kidd. Lewis, R MNS, Bombay blood group. etc.

Endonucleases : They cut DNA from within.
Restriction endonucleases or restriction enzymes :

They are the molecular scissors which recognize and cut the phosphodiester back bone of DNA on both strands, at highly specific sequences.
The 4 to 8 nucleotide long sites recognized by them are called recognition sequences or recognition sites.
Types of restriction enzyme :
Type I : They fuction simultaneously as endonuclease and methylase e.g. EcoKI.
Type II : They have separate cleaving and methylation activities e.g. EcoRI, Bgll. They cut DNA at specific sites within the palindrome.
Type III : They cut DNA at specific non-palindromic sequences e.g. Hpal, MboII.
Restriction cutting may result in DNA fragments with blunt ends or cohesive or sticky ends or staggered ends (having short, single stranded projections).

The rotation of earth along with its tilted axis, cause seasons. Due to seasons there are rain and snow which demarcate the major biomes of the earth. E.g. desert, tropical rain forest, temperate forest, coniferous forest, grassland, tundra, etc. are six major terrestrial biomes.

Biomes → Habitats → Biotic components. E.g. plants, pathogens, parasites and predators.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 13 Organisms and Populations 1

3. Ethology : Study of behaviour of animals in relation to their environment is ethology. The term was coined by Hilaire. Term popularised by W. M. Wheeler.

4. Bionomics : The study of relation between. organisms to their environment is called bionomics. Lankester (1890) coined this term.

5. Environmental biology (Modern ecology) : Study of functional or physiological interrelationships between the organism and their surroundings. G. L. Clarke (1964) and Odum (1969) introduced this term.

6. Biosphere : All the ecosystems on earth constitute biosphere.

7. Habitat and Niche :

Habitat : Place or area where a particular  species lives is called habitat.
Factors deciding presence of organisms in a particular habitat : Sunlight, average : rainfall, annual temperatures, type of soil, topographic factors, etc.
Types of habitats : Arboreal, terrestrial, aerial, aquatic, etc.
Microhabitat : Small part of the habitat which forms immediate surrounding of an organism.
Niche : The functional role played by an organism in its environment is called niche. Term given by J. Grinnell. Niche includes various aspects of the life of an organism like diet, shelter, and its link with physical and biological environment.
Habitat is a postal address while niche is the profession of organism.
(7) Types of niche :

Major Abiotic Factors –

1. Key abiotic factors : Ambient temperature, availability of water, light and type of soil.

(1) Temperature :

(i) Ecologically relevant environmental factors showing seasonal variations.

Progressive decrease of the temperature from the equator towards the poles and from plains to the mountain tops.
In polar areas and at high altitude : below zero °C.
Tropical deserts : more than 50 °C in summer.
In thermal springs : 80 to 100 °C.
In deep sea hydrothermal vents : about 400 °C.
(ii) Distribution of animals and plant species is mainly dependent on the ambient temperature. Animals are geographically distributed according to their levels of thermal tolerance.

(iii) Temperature can affect the kinetics of enzymes in the body and thus alter the basal metabolism, organism’s activity and other physiological functions.

(iv) Eurythermal : Organisms that can tolerate and thrive in a wide range of temperature fluctuations are called eurythermal.

(v) Stenothermal : Organisms restricted to a narrow range of temperatures are called stenothermal.

(2) Water :

Water is the second most important factor influencing the life of organisms.
Life on earth originated in water and can sustain only due to water.
Availability of water changes according to geographical regions. It also decides the productivity and distribution of plants.
Even for aquatic organisms the chemical composition and pH of water are important qualities.
Salinity or the Salt concentration : Unit of salinity is parts per thousand. (%o)

Inland waters : Salinity is less than 5%o.
Sea : 30 – 35 %o
Hypersaline lagoons : 100%o
Euryhaline : Organisms that can tolerate wide range of salinities.
Stenohaline : Organisms that Eire restricted to a narrow range of salinity.
Many freshwater animals cannot live for long in sea water and vice versa because of the osmotic problems they would face.
(3) Light :

Sunlight is the ultimate source of energy. Photosynthesis depends upon the availability of sunlight. Hence for autotrophs it is a very essential abiotic factor.
Species of herbs and shrubs growing in forests are adapted to photosynthesis even under very low light conditions because they are constantly under a canopy of tall trees.
Flowering of plants is dependent on sunlight to meet their photoperiodic requirement of the plants.
In animals the diurnal and seasonal rhythms are dependent on the sunlight. Foraging, reproductive and migratory activities of animals depend upon photoperiod.
The availability of light on land is closely linked with that of temperature since the sun is the source for both.
In oceanic depths (> 500m) the environment is perpetually dark and its inhabitants are well adapted to this dark life. They are carnivorous.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 13 Organisms and Populations

(4) Soil :

Climate of a place determines the nature and properties of the soil.
The weathering process, type of soil (sedimentary or transported), pattern of soil development, soil composition, grain size differs from place to place. Therefore, the soil characteristics are also varied.
The percolation and water holding capacity of the soils depend upon the soil composition, aggregation of particles and grain size.
The vegetation in many areas is dependent upon soil parameters such as pH, mineral composition and topography. Based on these characteristics the vegetation and the faunal pattern is seen.
The sediment-characteristics in the aquatic environment, determine the type of resident benthic animals.
2. Types of organisms according to abiotic factors : The abiotic factors change due to diurnal and seasonal variations. For survival, organisms adapt to these variations in the following four ways. By these mechanisms they maintain homeostasis or steady internal state.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 13 Organisms and Populations 3

Adaptation-

1. Adaptations enable the organism to survive and reproduce in its habitat.
2. Adaptations are of following types :

(1) Physiological adaptations : Thermoregulation and Osmoregulation.
(2) Behavioural adaptations :

Migration
Hibernation and aestivation
Behavioural responses to cope with variations in their environment.
Desert lizards → bask in the sun and absorb heat when temperature is cold. → move into shade → when the ambient temperature is more.
Burrowing into the sand for escaping heat.
(3) Morphological adaptations :

Desert plants : Thick cuticle on leaf surfaces, sunken stomata → minimizing loss of water through transpiration. CAM → Crassulacean acid metabolism pathway of photosynthesis. Modified leaves to spines, flattened green stems performing photosynthesis.
Mammals from cold climate region : Shorter snout, ears, tail and limbs to minimize the loss of body heat (Allen’s Rule).
Aquatic polar mammals → thick layer of blubber below their skin → insulator → minimize loss of body heat.
Population-

1. Population : Group of organisms in a well- defined geographical area which shares or competes for similar resources and which potentially interbreed with each other is called population. At the population level natural selection operates and desired traits are evolved.

2. Population ecology : An important area of ecology that links ecology to population dynamics, genetics and evolution.

3. Population attributes : Basic physical characteristics of population are called population attributes.

(1) Natality : Birth rate of a population.

Crude birth rate : Used for calculating population size (number of births per 1000 population/year).
Specific birth rate : Used when a specific criterion such as age has to be considered.
Absolute Natality : The number of births under ideal conditions when there is no competition and resources such as food and water, etc. are abundant.
Realized Natality: The number of births when environmental pressures are operating on the population.
(2) Mortality : Death rate of a population.

Absolute Mortality : Number of deaths under ideal conditions when there is no competition and resources, like food and water are abundant.
Realized Mortality : Number of deaths when environmental pressures are operating on the population.
Absolute mortality will always be less than realized mortality.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 13 Organisms and Populations

(3) Sex ratio : The ratio of the number of individuals of one sex to that of the other sex is sex ratio. Birth, death, immigration and emigration, etc. affect sex ratio.

Evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) : The males and females of a population should be in a ratio of 1 : 1.

(4) Age distribution and Age pyramid : Age pyramid is the figure plotted for a population to show age distribution. Age distribution is done in following way : Pre-reproductive (0-14 years), Reproductive (15-44 years) and Post-reproductive (45-85+ years).

(5) Population size or population density (N) : Population density is the number of individuals present per unit space in given time. Population’s status in the habitat indicate population size. The biomass is also more meaningful measure of the population size.

(6) Population Growth : The size of a population keeps changing with time, depending on various factors including food, predation pressure and adverse weather.

Density of population in a habitat during a given period, fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes : (i) New births (ii) Immigration (iii) Deaths (iv) Emigration.
Of these new births and immigration increase the population growth while deaths and emigration decrease population growth.

(7) Immigration (I) : Number of individuals of the same species that enter the habitat from elsewhere during specific time period under consideration.

(8) Emigration (E) : It is the number of individuals of the population who leave the habitat during specific time period.

So, if N is the population density at time ‘t’, then its density at time ‘t + 1′ can be calculated
as, Nt + 1 = Nt + [(B + I) – (D + E)]

4. Growth Models :

Exponential growth.
Logistic growth
Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth : A plot of N in relation to time (t) results in a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth.
Since resources for growth of most animal populations are finite and become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model is considered as a more realistic one.
Population Interactions-

1. Interactions are of two types in the living species :

Intraspecific : Interaction existing between organisms of same species’ population.
Interspecific : Interaction between members of different species.
2. Classification of population interactions :
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 13 Organisms and Populations 4

(3) Gause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ :

This principle states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually.
The Gause’s principle may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross generalisations about competition.

,,,14. Ecosystems and Energy Flow,"Introduction-

Self-regulatory and self -sustaining structural and functional unit of biosphere.
Consists of biotic and abiotic components.
The term ecosystem was coined by Tansley.
Ecosystems are of variable sizes from small pond to large ocean.
Global ecosystem means entire biosphere.
Two basic categories :
(1) Terrestrial (forest, grassland, desert)
(2) Aquatic (lakes, rivers, wetlands, estuaries)
Also classified as natural ecosystem which is not based on any human inputs and artificial ecosystem which is dependent on man for constant inputs of energy or material.
Dynamics of ecosystem : Input of ecosystem means productivity, transfer of energy in ecosystem is by a food chain, food web and nutrient cycling and output of ecosystem means degradation and energy loss.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow

Ecosystem-

1. Structure and function :

(1) Physical structure of ecosystem means the interaction of biotic and abiotic components in that ecosystem.

(2) Species composition of an ecosystem is understood by identification and enumeration of resident plant and animal species.

(3) Spatial pattern is the variation in ecosystem due to space. This is of two types, viz. stratification and zonation.

Stratification : Vertical distribution of species of plants and animals at different levels. E.g. Trees, herbs, shrubs among plant species. Epipelagic, meso pelagic, bathypelagic and benthic among aquatic communities.
Zonation : Horizontal distribution of plants and animals either on land or in water. E.g. Zonation in aquatic system : intertidal, littoral, sublittoral zones.
Zonation in wetlands : Sub tidal channels, mudflats, Low marsh, high marsh
2. Functional aspects of ecosystem : Productivity, Decomposition, Nutrient cycling and Energy flow are the four functional aspects of any ecosystem.

(1) Productivity :

Conversion of inorganic substances into organic material using solar energy by the autotrophs is called productivity. Consumption of autotrophs by heterotrophs.
Solar energy is a must for any ecosystem for sustenance.
Rate of generation of biomass in an ecosystem expressed as gram/sq. metre/ day.
Gross primary productivity (GPP) : Rate of production of organic matter by photosynthesis.
Net primary productivity (NPP) : Net
Primary Productivity = Gross primary productivity – respiratory losses.
NPP is available biomass which heterotrophs can use.
Annual NPP of whole biosphere = 170 billion tons dry weight of organic matter. Ocean productivity = 55 billion tons.
Factors on which GPP depends :

Resident plant species
Availability of nutrients
Photosynthetic capacity of plants
Type of ecosystem
Secondary productivity : Rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers. This is available energy which is transferred to next trophic level.

(2) Decomposition :

Breakdown of complex organic material and forming inorganic minerals from the dead matter is called decomposition.
Detritus is raw material which is decomposed.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow 1

Factors regulating decomposition :

Enough oxygen availability as it is an oxygen-requiring process.
Chemical composition of detritus.
Climatic factors.
If detritus is rich in lignin and chitin the rate of decomposition rate is slower. If the detritus is rich in nitrogen and sugars the rate is faster.
Most important factors for decomposition are temperature and soil moisture. These factors affect activities of soil microbes. In warm and moist environment decomposition is faster whereas in low temperature and in absence of oxygen, the decomposition is inhibited.
(3) Nutrient cycling : Storage and transport of nutrients.

(4) Energy flow : Flow of energy from producer to consumer in unidirectional way. Dissipation and loss of heat during energy flow is inevitable.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow

Energy flow –

The ultimate source of energy for all the globed ecosystems is sun. However, in deep sea hydrothermal ecosystem solar energy does not reach.
 Less than 50% of solar radiation that falls on the earth’s surface is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Only 2-10 % of PAR sustains the entire living world.
Plants and autotrophic bacteria fix solar radiant energy into complex carbohydrates while using simple inorganic materials. Plants thus are the producers that supply the energy in the form of food to consumers.
There is always unidirectional flow of energy ; from the sun to autotrophic producers and : then to heterotrophic consumers.
Second Law of thermodynamics operates for the ecosystems too. The universal tendency towards increasing disorderliness is always counteracted by producers and consumers.
Organisms in the ecosystem need a constant : supply of energy to survive and synthesise the : required molecules.
Major primary producers are herbaceous and woody plants in a terrestrial ecosystem. In an aquatic ecosystem primary producers are phytoplankton and algae.
Food chain/Food web : The chain or web formed due to interdependency among various organisms of the ecosystem is known as food chain.
Energy that is trapped into an organism keeps on flowing. Producers trap the energy and pass it further to a consumer. If the producer dies, the death of organism starts the detritus food chain/web.
All animals directly or indirectly depend on : plants to obtain their food. They cannot synthesise their own food so they are called ; heterotrophs or consumers.
Primary consumers : Consumers feeding directly on the producers are called primary consumers. For example, Herbivorous animals. Insects, birds and some mammals are herbivores or primary consumers in the terrestrial ecosystem and molluscs are primary consumers in aquatic ecosystem.
Secondary consumers : The animals consuming other animals are secondary consumers. For example, Carnivores. Primary carnivores are secondary consumers. Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers.
Tertiary consumers : Animals feeding on secondary consumers are called tertiary consumers.
For example, in the food chain “Plant matter → Insect → Frog → Snake”, insect is primary consumer, frog is secondary consumer and snake is the tertiary consumer.
Food chains are of two types : Grazing food chain and detritus food chain.
(1) A simple grazing food chain (GFC) is shown as follows :
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow 2

(2) The detritus food chain (DFC) is made up of decomposers. It starts with dead and decaying matter. Examples of decomposers are fungi and bacteria. Decomposers are also called heterotrophic saprotrophs. (sapro : to decompose). By degrading dead organic matter or detritus, decomposers meet their nutritional and energy requirements. Digestive enzymes of saprotrophs breakdown dead and waste materials into simple inorganic materials before their absorption which are subsequently absorbed by them.

(3) In an aquatic ecosystem energy flow occurs only through grazing food chains whereas in a terrestrial ecosystem, majority of energy flow occurs through the detritus food chain.

(4) There are interconnections between detritus i food chain and grazing food chain at some levels. Some organisms of DFC serve as prey & to the GFC animals. Some animals like cockroaches, crows, pig and mam, etc. are omnivores.

(5) The natural interconnection of food chains is called a food web.

15. Diagrammatic representations of trophic levels in an ecosystem

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow 3

At each successive trophic level, the amount of energy available goes on reducing. The trophic levels in any food chain transfer the energy when it is functioned.
‘10% Law’ of R. Lindermann, 1942 : The law states that ‘only 10% of the energy is transferred to each trophic level as net energy, from the previous trophic level’.
Food chains are never in isolation, but are always interconnected to form food web for maintaining the stability of an ecosystem.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow

Ecological Pyramids-

1. Ecological pyramid is the expression drawn to indicate number, biomass or energy in an ecosystem.

2. The broad base and narrow apex of a pyramid rightly expresses the food or energy relationship within different trophic level. The producers or the first trophic level is shown as a base of each pyramid while the apex represents tertiary or top level consumer.

3. The three types of ecological pyramids are :

Pyramid of number
Pyramid of biomass and
Pyramid of energy.
4. The calculations of energy content, biomass, or number include all organisms at that trophic level. Some organisms may occupy more than one trophic level simultaneously, e.g. A primary consumer sparrow can become secondary consumer when it feeds on insects. The trophic level thus represents a functional level and not a species as such.

5. All the pyramids, of number, of energy and biomass are upright in most of the ecosystems, i.e., producers always outnumber the consumers. Similarly biomass is more for producers than that of the herbivores. Herbivores or primary consumers outnumber carnivores. Energy at a higher trophic level is always less than energy at the lower trophic level.

6. Exceptions to pyramid structure :

The pyramid of biomass in sea is also generally inverted as the biomass of fishes far exceeds that of phytoplankton.
Many insects and birds thriving on a single huge tree will also show inverted pyramid of numbers.
7. When energy flows from a lower trophic level to the next trophic level, some energy is always lost as heat at each step. Therefore the pyramid of energy is always upright. It is never inverted. In the energy pyramid, the amount of energy in a given time and per unit area is shown by each bar.

8. Limitations of the ecological pyramids :

Ecological pyramids do not take into account the same species belonging to two or more trophic levels.
They are based on simple food chain. In nature simple food chains do not exist but all the trophic relationships are in the form of food web.
Saprophytes play a major and vital role in the ecosystem but they are not shown in ecological pyramids.
9. C. Elton in 1927 developed the concept of ecological pyramids.

Nutrient cycles-

1. Nutrient cycling : Nutrient cycling or biogeochemical cycle is the movement of nutrient elements through various components of ecosystem.
2. Two types of nutrient cycles :

Gaseous (nitrogen, oxygen and carbon) having reservoir in atmosphere.
Sedimentary (Phosphorus, Sulphur) having Earth’s crust as reservoir.
3. Carbon Cycle : (Gaseous cycle)

Five basic processes running the carbon cycle : Photos ynthesis, respiration, decomposition, sedimentation and combustion.
Main component of all organic compounds in protoplasm is carbon.
49% of dry weight of organisms is carbon.
Out of total global carbon, 71% carbon is present in oceans.
Atmospheric Carbon dioxide regulation is done by oceanic reservoir.
Long term storage places or sinks : Carbon which is a part of rocks and fossil fuels is called long tern storage of carbon.
The fossil fuels from this sink when burnt, releases carbon dioxide into atmosphere.
Elemental carbon found in seawater, atmosphere, – limestone, coal, soil and in living beings.
Moment of carbon dioxide from atmosphere to plants is through photosynthesis.
Carbon dioxide given out through plants and animals during respiration.
Carbon also moves along the food chains.
Carbon dioxide is released into atmosphere by decomposers during decomposition! process of organic matter on land and in oceans.
Burning of fossil fuels in industries and for vehicular traffic releases carbon dioxide.
5.5 billion tonnes of carbon released in atmosphere, of these 3.3 billion tonnes stay in atmosphere and rest dissolves in seawater and gets deposited as calcium or magnesium carbonate compounds used for forming marine animals’ shells.
Forest fires, volcanic activities are other natural sources releasing carbon dioxide.
Anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and excessive burning of fossil fuel has tremendously increased amount of carbon dioxide in atmosphere.
4. Phosphorus cycle : (Sedimentary cycle)

Phosphorus cyclically moves through hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere.
It is a major constituent of biological
membranes, nucleic acids and cellular energy transfer systems. .
Animals require large quantities of phosphorus to make shells, bones, hooves and teeth.
The natural reservoirs are rocks containing phosphates.
Weathering of rocks release minute amounts of phosphates in soil solution which is needed by plants.
Herbivores and other animals get phosphorus through plants.
Decomposition of waste products and the dead organisms by phosphate-solubilizing bacteria release phosphorus.
Phosphorus is always in short supply, thus acts as a limiting factor for the plant growth.
Eutrophication : Eutrophication is the sudden influx of phosphorus in water bodies due to agricultural runoff or industrial effluents which are rich in phosphate content.
Eutrophication causes overgrowth of algae which kills or harms the aquatic life
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow

Ecological succession-

1. Ecological succession : The gradual and fairly predictable change in the species composition of a given area is called ecological succession. It is a community response to the environment over time.

2. All communities constantly change their composition and structure in accordance with the changing environmental conditions. This change is orderly and sequential, parallel with the changes in the physical environment.

3. Climax community : Community that is in near equilibrium with the environment after the ecological succession.
The change is sequential and environmentally regulated in climax community.

4. Process of succession involves following sequential steps :

Nudation
Invasion
Ecesis
Aggregation
Competition and co-action
Reaction and stabilization.
Learn This As Well :
1916, Frederic Clements published a descriptive theory of succession which is called classical ecological theory. His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. He has given following phases of succession :

Nudation : Nudation is disturbance. Succession begins with the development of a bare site.
Migration : The tiny seeds or propagules arrive during this phase.
Ecesis : Ecesis is the establishment and initial growth of vegetation.
Competition : When vegetation becomes well-formed and established, it grows and competes with other species for space, light and nutrients.
Reaction : Autogenic changes such as the build-up of humus affect the habitat, and one plant community replaces another during this phase.
Stabilization : The community which is better, becomes stable forming a Climax community.
5. Some populations become more numerous, whereas some populations decline and even disappear during the succession. Newer species also colonise the areas.

6. Sere : Sere is the entire sequence of communities that successively change in a given area. Serai stages or serai communities are the individual transitional communities in this sere.

7. Following changes take place in the successive serai stages :

Change in the diversity of species of organisms,
Increase in the number of species and organisms,
Increase in the total biomass.
8. Similar succession is said to have taken place in past over millions of years forming the present day global communities. Succession and evolution were the parallel processes in the past and also at the present.

9. Succession is of two types, viz. Primary succession and secondary succession.

Primary succession : It is the process that starts where no living organisms are there, e.g. bare rock, newly cooled lava, newly created pond or reservoir. The primary succession is very slow process of establishment of a new biotic community. Factors such as soil, climatic conditions, etc. The natural processes that take place for thousands of years till the new community is established.

Secondary succession : It occurs in areas where all life forms were lost that existed before. It begins in places like abandoned farmlands, burned or cut forests, lands that have been flooded, etc. Secondary succession is faster as some abiotic factors such as soil or sediment are already present there.

10. Ecological succession usually focuses on changes in vegetation. But when the vegetation changes, it in turn affects various types of animals as animals are dependent on plants for their food and shelter.

11. Therefore, with process of succession the numbers and types of animals and decomposers also show change.

12. Natural or human induced disturbances (fire, deforestation, etc.), in a normal succession pattern can convert a particular serai stage of succession to an earlier stage or create new conditions that encourage some species and eliminate other species.

13. Succession of Plants :

Succession of plants can be of hydrarch (in wet areas) or xerarch (in very dry areas) based on the nature of the habitat.
In hydrarch succession, successional series progress from hydric to the mesic conditions.
In xerarch succession, successional series progress from xeric to mesic conditions.
Both hydrarch and xerarch successions lead to mesic (medium water) conditions but neither too xeric nor too hydric.
14. Pioneer species : The species that initially invade a barren area is called pioneer species.

Ecosystem Services-

1. Ecosystem services: Ecosystem services are the products of ecosystem and processes which comprise of economic, environmental, aesthetic goods and services.
2. Millennium ecosystem assessment report 2005 as given definition of ecosystem services as follows ecosystem services is dcfincd as benefits which are obtained by people from ecosystem.
3. There are four types of ecosystem services:
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 14 Ecosystems and Energy Flow 4

4. Main important ecological services on earth without which life would not have been possible:

FIxation of atmospheric CO2 and release of O2, by photosynthesis and intake of oxygen and release
of CO2 in respiration.
Pollination of plants brought about by wind, water or other blotic agencies.
MaintaIning biodiversity.",Disease resistant varieties of different crops :,,,,
,,,"15. Biodiversity, Conversation and Environmental Issues","Introduction-

Biodiversity: A variety of life that includes a vast array of species from microorganisms, viruses, algae, fungi, plants and animals present in different habitats on the earth is called biodiversity.
Diversity is seen in shape, colour, form, mode of nutrition, habitats, reproduction, motility, duration of the life cycle, life span, etc. All of these adaptations help in the survival of species and hence diverse forms are seen.
The term Biodiversity was coined by Walter Rosen in 1982.
Edward Wilson popularised the term. He described it as combined diversity at different levels of biological organisation.
Definition of biodiversity: Biodiversity is the part of nature that includes differences in the genes among individuals of a species, variety of animal and plant species in different habitats, regions, countries and the world which form different types of ecosystems within a defined area.
Biodiversity was developed for 3.5 billion years when the evolution took place gradually.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

Levels of biodiversity-

Various levels at which diversity can be seen ranging from molecular to ecosystem levels. The three main levels, which form a hierarchy and interrelation: Genetic diversity, species diversity (community), and ecosystem diversity (Ecological diversity).
Genetic diversity: Also called intraspecific diversity. The diversity present in the number and types of genes and chromosomes present in different species and variations in them and their alleles in the same species is called genetic diversity. Subspecies and races are also examples of genetic diversity.
Species diversity: Also called interspecific diversity. The diversity in the number of species of plants and animals which are present in a particular region is called species diversity. Species diversity decides species richness (variety of species) and species evenness (number of individuals of different species).
Ecological or ecosystem diversity: The diversity of different types of ecosystems and habitats
within a given geographical area is called ecological or ecosystem diversity. E.g. Deserts, rain forests, deciduous forests, estuaries, wetlands, grasslands are different ecosystems with diverse features.
Patterns of biodiversity-

Latitudinal and altitudinal gradient and species-area relationship are the two patterns of diversity.
Latitudinal species diversity: There is greater species richness at a lower latitude which steadily declines towards the poles. This is called as distribution of diversity along the latitudes.
The overall stability of tropical regions, lesser annual climatic changes, availability of plenty of sunlight, lesser drastic disturbances like periodic glaciations, lesser migrations causing reduced gene flow, normal temperature, and higher annual rainfall are all the factors that cause more diversity in these regions.
Altitudinal species diversity: The diversity is more at lower altitudes, but at higher altitudes, it declines due to change in climatic conditions and drastic seasonal variations.
Species area relationship: The number of species present in any area is directly proportional to the size of this area. Species richness increases with an increase in the area up to a certain limit this was observed by Alexander wan Humboldt.
Importance of species diversity to the ecosystem: A stable community has fairly constant average biomass production over a particular time period. It withstands the disturbance and recovers quickly and also resists the invasive species.
Productivity stability hypothesis (David Tillman): Rich diversity leads to lesser variation in the production of biomass over a particular time period.
Rivet Popper hypothesis (Paul Ehrlich): Relationship between diversity and wellbeing of the ecosystem is not linear. When key species are lost there is a threat in a very short span of time which affects the food chain, food web, energy flow, and natural cycles resulting in an imbalance of the ecosystem.
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

Biodiversity current scenario-

According to the IUCN data (2004), over 1.5 million species have been documented so far but still lot more are yet to be studied.
Most of the temperate species have been studied but tropical species are yet to be explored.
Robert May estimated that there are 7 million species on the earth.
India has 8.1% of total global biodiversity. India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries. On total Indian land area which is 2.4% of the world, there are about 45000 plant species and 90000 animal varieties. 22% of global natural wealth has been recorded so far.
But due to rapid deforestation and reclamation, many species and varieties could be lost forever before they are documented.
Loss of biodiversity-

1. Imbalance in the ecosystem occurs if biodiversity is lost. Extinction of species means a threat to biodiversity.
2. Three types of extinctions are :

Natural extinction: Occurring due to natural causes such as forest fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc.
Mass extinction: Great impact causing major loss of species.
Manmade or Anthropogenic extinction: Habitat destruction, hunting, settlement, overexploitation, reclamation are man-made causes of extinction.
3. There were five mass extinctions during different stages of the history of Earth.
4. The sixth extinction is taking place now which is a hundred to a thousand times faster than that
occurred in pre-human times.50% of diversity is said to be lost and this loss of biodiversity can alter environmental processes such as plant productivity and disease cycles.

5. Causes of biodiversity losses :
(1) Four major causes of biodiversity loss, known as an evil quartet.

Habitat loss and fragmentation
Overexploitation
Alien species invasion
Co-extinctions
(2) Extinct species: The species which are totally eliminated from the Earth.
E.g. Dinosaurs

(3) Endangered species: The species having dwindling numbers.

(4) The international union for conservation of nature and natural resources (IUCN) maintains a red data Book or red list to record the conservation status of plant and animal species.

(5) Categories of species according to IUCN:

Extinct (EX)
Extinct in the wild (EW)
Critically endangered (CR)
Endangered (EN)
Vulnerable (VU)
Near threatened (NT)
Least concern (LC)
Data deficient (DD)
Not evaluated (NE)
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

Conservation and biodiversity-

1. Protection, upliftment, and scientific management of biodiversity so that it can remain at optimum level and give us sustainable benefits is called conservation of biodiversity.
2. Reasons for conservation of biodiversity :

(1) Narrowly utilitarian reasons: Humans obtain benefits from biodiversity in the form of resources for food, cloth, shelter industrial products, aesthetic products, ornaments, artifacts, and medicines.
Bioprospecting is done for systematically searching the new sources of chemical compounds, genes, microorganisms, and other valuable products that we could obtain from nature.

(2) Broadly utilitarian reasons: Oxygen supply, seed dispersal, pollination, extra aspects that nature gives us free.

(3) Ethical reasons: Humans share the earth with all the other diverse life forms and all of them have equal rights to survive. Therefore, ethically we should not finish them for our prospective economic use.

3. Conservation of biodiversity :

(1) In situ conservation :

The protection of an organism in its natural surrounding or habitat is called in situ conservation.
34 biodiversity hotspots having high species richness and high density are strategically protected under in situ conservation in India.
Traditionally used varieties for farming and horticulture are also conserved by this method.
The Western Ghats, Indo-Burma, and Eastern Himalayas are 3 of world’s biodiversity hotspots located in India.
In India, there Eire 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks, 448 wildlife sanctuaries, sacred groves are also typed of in situ conservation in which flora and fauna are protected in the name of God.
Sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia hills in Meghalaya, in Western Ghats of Maharashtra (especially Sindhudurg district), and Karnataka, Aravalli hills of Rajasthan and Bastar, Chanda and Sarguja areas in Madhya Pradesh.
(2) Ex-situ conservation :

Critically endangered species are protected in captivity, which is called ex-situ conservation.
An ex-situ conservation, living beings are protected in wildlife safari parks, zoological parks, botanical gardens, etc.
Seed banks, tissue culture, cryopreservation, etc. are modern techniques that are used in this conservation method.
Biological Diversity Act 2002-

1. Earth Summit, held at Rio de Janeiro came out with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD-1992).
2. Indian Government has passed Biological Diversity Act (BD Act) in the year 2002 in compliance with CBD.
3. It gives framework for the sustainable management and conservation of our country’s natural resources. The law excludes value added products and human genetic material.
4. The main objectives for proposing this act are

Regulation of access to Indian biological resources.
Scientific cataloguing of traditional knowledge about ethnobiological materials.
5. There is three tier system in India, comprising of

National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) at the national level
State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs) at the state level
Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) at the local level.
Environmental issues-

1. To protect and improve the quality of our environment, Indian Government has passed the Environment Protection Act in 1986.
2. Reasons for rampant loss of natural resources :

Exponential growth of human population
Industrial development
Uncontrolled exploitation of nature
Utilization and production of synthetic materials
Construction activities
Resultant pollution
Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

3. Types of pollution :

Air pollution, Noise pollution, Water pollution, Radioactive pollution, Soil pollution are different types of pollution.
Pollutant: Substance that causes pollution is called a pollutant.
4. Air pollution :

(1) Unfavourable alteration in air quality causing damage to the respiratory system is called air pollution.
(2) Duration of exposure, concentration of pollutant and type of organism decide the severity of damage caused by air pollution.
(3) In plants, yield of crops are affected. Premature death of plants is another effect of air pollution.
(4) Major cause of air pollution is automobile traffic.

(5) Types of air pollutants : Two main types -> Particulate and Gaseous pollutants.

Particles of less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter are extremely harmful to humans.
Gaseous pollutants : CO, CO2, SO2, NO, NO2, etc.


Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues 2

(6) Control measures for air pollution : For controlling emissions of gases and particulate pollutants which are released through vehicles and industries following devices are used :

Electrostatic precipitator
Exhaust gas scrubbers
Catalytic converters
(7) Noise pollution :

Noise is considered as an air pollutant which causes psychological and physiological changes in human beings.
Sound level can damage the ear drum causing permanent hearing loss. Other problems that noise causes are sleeplessness, increased heartbeat, altered breathing, psychological stress, interference in learning etc.
Sources of noise pollution : Machines, transportation, construction sites and industry.
Using sound absorbing material can cause reduction in noise pollution.
5. Water pollution :

Most of the water pollution is manmade.
Smelling water having many pathogens, heavy metals and oils is called polluted water.
Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act 1974 to safeguard the water resources.
Domestic sewage and Industrial effluents cause water pollution.
(5) Domestic sewage contains biodegradable organic matter which can be removed by treatment.
BOD or biochemical oxygen demand is a measure to estimate biodegradable organic matter present in the polluted water.  It is defined as the amount of dissolved oxygen required by microorganisms for decomposing the organic matter present in water which is expressed in milligram of oxygen per litre (mg/L) of water.
Algal bloom : Excessive growth of free floating planktonic blue green algae causes algal bloom. It releases toxins in the water causing death of inhabitant fish. –
Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) : Commonly called Terror of Bengal’ is an invasive species which grows excessively in water bodies and cause nuisance.
Natural eutrophication : Ageing of lake over a very long period due to nutrient enrichment of water is called natural eutrophication.
Cultural or accelerated eutrophication: Pollutants passing in the water body due to human activities cause cultural eutrophication in which there is accelerated aging process for the water body.
Biological magnification or biomagnification : Accumulation of certain pollutant in the tissues of organisms and their increasing concentrations along the food chain is called biomagnification. E.g. DDT and mercury show biomagnification.
6. Thermal pollution : When the temperature of water is raised due to human activities, it causes thermal pollution. E.g. Effluents from thermal and nuclear power plants. Sensitive organisms are killed due to raised temperature, thus thermal pollution causes loss of flora and fauna.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

7. Ecosan or Ecological sanitation :

Use of excreta as agricultural manure in a safe and reusable manner is called ecological sanitation.
Principle of recovery and recycling of nutrients is practised in this way.
Ecosan is a closed system toilet which requires no water and is an alternative to leach pit toilet.
Through such toilets composted organic manure is formed.
8. Reverse osmosis : Sewage water is reused after performing reverse osmosis.
It solves the problem of water scarcity and treatment of sewage water.

9. Rainwater harvesting : By harvesting rainwater, scarcity of water can be solved. For new constructions now it is mandatory to have provision for RWH.

10. Solid waste management :

(1) Everything that is disposed into the trash is called solid wastes.

(2) Municipal wastes : Wastes from homes, offices, stores, schools, hospitals, etc. together are called Municipal wastes. Municipality collects and disposes the same. It may contain paper, food wastes, plastics, glass, metals, rubber, leather, textile, etc.

(3) One of the ways to dispose the solid waste is to burn them. Volume of the waste is reduced by burning but burning creates air pollution.

(4) Sanitary landfills : Dumping the trash in open can attract rats and flies causing open dumps as the breeding ground for these pests. Therefore, sanitary landfills are created. At sanitary landfill sites, the wastes are compacted and buried in trenches. Everyday newer trash is added to landfills.

(5) However, this method is not a fool proof solution for the waste management as in large metro cities amount of trash is increasing day by day and hence such landfills are falling short. There is also seepage of dangerous chemicals from the sanitary landfills which results into the pollution of underground water reserves.

(6) Therefore, every human being should be sensitized towards the environmental issues. Common man should have ecological conscience to reduce the non-biodegradable trash.

(7) The solid wastes are categorized into three types :

(1) Bio-degradable
(2) Recyclable
(3) Non-biodegradable.

(8) The generated garbage should be sorted prior to disposal. The matter that could be reused or recycled should not be thrown into trash but to be given to kabadiwallahs and rag¬pickers.

(9) The biodegradable materials undergo natural breakdown. Therefore they can be buried deep down in the ground in pits.

(10) The non-biodegradable material should be reduced at source to curb the garbage generation. Packaging material, plastics, polybags, etc. which are used to a greater extent in modern times cause environmental pollution. Use of eco-friendly packaging and reduction in plastic has been advocated by the State Governments.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

(11) Biomedical wastes : Hazardous wastes generated by hospitals contain disinfectants, harmful chemicals and disease-causing pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore such wastes should be carefully handled, treated and then disposed. For disposal of harmful biomedical wastes the incinerators are used.

(12) Electronic wastes (e-wastes) :

e-wastes are any material of electronic origin, such as irreparable computers, mobile phones, CDs, floppies, batteries, etc.
e-wastes are managed by burying them in landfills or they are incinerated.
e-wastes generated in the developed world are exported to developing countries for further recycling and disposal.
In China, India and Pakistan, metals like copper, iron, silicon, nickel and gold are recovered from e-wastes during recycling process.
Developed countries, have facilities for recycling of e-wastes. But it involves manual participation and this exposes the workers to toxic substances present in e-wastes. For treating e-wastes, recycling is the only control measure. But it has to be done in an eco-friendly r manner.
11. Anti-plastic notifications : Government of Maharashtra has banned used of plastic by notification (23rd June 2018). This is a mission to make ‘Plastic Free Maharashtra’.

Greenhouse effect and Global warming-

1. Greenhouse effect :

The greenhouse effect is the phenomenon that occurs naturally on the earth.
The average temperature at surface of earth is increased due to greenhouse effect. If it would
not have been there, the temperature of the earth would have been -18 °C. But due to the greenhouse now it is at the average 15 °C. This was called a good greenhouse effect.
But in recent years the excessive greenhouse effect is causing generalized global warming and climate change.
Infrared radiations are trapped due to atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, etc. These gases absorb a major fraction of it and re-radiate the heat energy back to the earth’s surface. This exchange of heat goes in a cyclic manner.
Carbon dioxide and methane are main greenhouse gases; additionally, chloroflorocarbons (CFC), Nitrous oxide (N2O) and water vapours add to this effect.
2. Global warming :

(1) Due to air pollution and increased burning of fuels there is an increase in the proportion of greenhouse gases. The loss of forests and tree cover also adds to the increased CO2 concentration. All this has led to global warming.
(2) In the last 100 years there is an increase in the Earth’s temperature by about 0.6 °C. Especially in last three decades the climate change is severe. Problems like El Nino effect; melting of polar ice caps, Alps and Himalayas, etc. and increasing sea level leading to coastal submergence are all due to global warming.

3. Measures to reduce greenhouse effect and Global warming : Reduction in use of fossil fuel, improving efficiency

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

Ozone depletion-

1. In the upper stratosphere strata there is ozone layer. It is continuously formed by action of ultraviolet radiations on molecular oxygen. Molecular oxygen also degrades back into ozone in the stratosphere. Ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun and protects the flora and fauna from deleterious effects of radiation.

2. Living organisms are affected due to UV radiation because it causes damage to their DNA and proteins by breaking the chemical bonds within DNA and proteins.
3. The unit for measuring thickness of ozone is Dobson unit (DU).

4. A balance between production and degradation of ozone in the stratosphere is lately disturbed due to excessive proportion of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere.

5. Chlorofluorocarbons are used in refrigerators. When released they move upward and reach stratosphere. The ultraviolet rays in stratosphere, react with CFC and release Cl- atoms. Ozone is degraded by Cl “atoms.

6. This later causes ozone depletion or formation of ozone hole as it is clearly seen over the Antarctic region.

7. Deleterious effects of Ozone depletion :

Aging of skin.
Damage to skin cells causing skin cancers.
Inflammation of cornea of human eye causing snow-blindness cataract.
Permanent damage to the cornea.
UV-B radiation cause damage to DNA and mutations.
8. Montreal Protocol : An international treaty signed at Montreal (Canada) in 1987 (effective in 1989) to control the deleterious emission of ozone depleting substances like CFCs.

Deforestation –

1. Converting forested land into barren land is called deforestation.
2. Tropical forests are reduced by about 40% whereas temperate forests are lessened by 1% in the temperate region.
3. India is facing severe deforestation. There was 30% of forests in Indian land in early twentieth century. Now it has reduced to 19.4%.
4. It is recommended by National Forest Policy (1988) of India that the hilly area should have 67% while the plain area should have 33% forest cover.
5. Causes of deforestation :

Unplanned human activities.
Creation of agricultural land by cutting down forests.
For the timber and firewood, trees are felled and forests are cleared.
Clearing forests for cattle ranching.
Slash and burn agriculture or Jhum cultivation in the north-eastern parts of India.
Severe deforestation is caused due to increasing human population and repeated cultivation that resulted into shortening of recovery phase.
6. Consequences of deforestation :

Enhanced carbon dioxide concentration.

Carbon held in the biomass is lost with deforestation.
Loss of biodiversity due to habitat destruction.
Disturbance in the hydrologic cycle.
Soil erosion.
Desertification.
7. Reforestation : Restoring a forest that once existed is called reforestation.
There can be a natural reforestation or it can be due to human efforts by planting trees. However, when it is due to human efforts the natural biodiversity may be lost.

Maharashtra Board Class 12 Biology Notes Chapter 15 Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues

8. Environmental heroes : Reforestation undertaken by these two environmentalists.

Saalumara Thimmakka. (Karnataka)
Moirangthem Loiya (Manipur).
9. Case study of people’s participation in conservation of forests : Following examples show people’s participation in the conservation of forests :

(1) In 1731, Amrita Devi had sacrificed her life to save trees along with other people of Bishnoi’s community. It was the example of sacrificing lives for the cause of saving trees and environment.
Amrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife Protection Award for individuals or communities from rural areas has been installed by the Government of India.

(2) Chipko Movement is people’s participation for the protection of trees. This happened in 1974 in Garhwal region of Himalayas. Chipko movement has now spread world-wide in which people hug the trees and save it from the axe of tree-cutters.

(3) Joint Forest Management (JFM) has been introduced by the Government of India in 1980s for working with the local communities for protection and management of the forests. It is an attempt to conserve forests in a sustainable matter.

Mission Harit Maharashtra-

Government of Maharashtra has decided to plant 50 crore trees, district-wise in 4 years, starting from in the year 2016.
National Forest Policy (NFP) aims at maintaining 33% forest cover in India. This decision of government is in tune with NFP
Helpline number 1926 called ‘Hello Forest’ has been set up to provide information regarding plantation, protection and for mass awareness.
Mobile application called ‘My Plants’ to record details of the plantation such as numbers, species and location.
Japanese Miyawaki method of plantation has been adapted in districts like, Beed, Hingoli, Pune, Jalgaon, Aurangabad, etc.

Use of astrological equipment and shrewdness.
Collection of enough stuff for questioning & giving advice
Commenting habit on the customer’s nature, affairs, efforts and fate.
Creation of fear in the mind of the customer.
Use of general statements to endear the customers and win their hearts.
Use of wit & shrewdness.
 

Reasons for the astrologer to change his appearance and his persona after his arrival in the city-
The astrologer had quarreled & left his hometown.
He wanted to get rid of his past
He wished that no one should recognize him.
He wished his offence of killing Guru Nayak should not be revealed.
He wanted to begin a new life.
 

The astrologer opened his mouth only after listening to his customer and his problems-
The information given by people provided him enough stuff for a dozen answers and advices.
He got a chance to analyse the troubles of his customer.
He professionally followed the policy that- ‘those who hear a lot, learn a lot’.
He got enough time to predict answers and give advice.
 

The darkness load that was inside the astrologer has disappeared’. Through this sentence, explain the significance of the title ‘An Astrologer’s Day’-
The astrologer lived under the burden that he had the blood of man on his hands all those days. One day a stranger stood before him. He identified Guru Nayak & was upset. Guru Nayak was the person, with whom he had quarreled, & tried to kill. When he comes to know that Guru Nayak is alive, he becomes tension free. The day on which he was relieved from that load, was a special day for him. So that day is called ‘An Astrologer’s Day’

 

Critical justification & explanation of the astrologer’s feeling of relief that Guru is not dead as it relieves a great burden from him. –
The astrologer believed that he had murdered a person. The job of any astrologer is to predict the future happenings & understand important things from the client’s life. Ironically, the astrologer was himself unaware of his past life reality. Guru Nayak the person, with whom he had quarrelled, & tried to kill, one day comes before him as his customer. When he realizes that Guru Nayak is alive, he is relieved from his burden.

 

The astrologer wins/gets the sympathy of criticism of the readers in the end –
The astrologer was guilty of the crime of murder which he believed he had created in his past life. He wanted to get away from it. He had accepted his mistake and already started to live a new life. His smartness and the business tactics had saved him from his past crime. Acceptance of mistake is a great quality which is rarely found. His perception, presence of mind, self-confidence and shrewdness helped him to win his clients. In the end, when the astrologer realizes that the person who he believed was killed by him was dead, is actually alive, not only he is relieved from his burden but also the readers have a sense of relief for him. He had learnt a lesson hence the astrologer got sympathy from the readers.

 

Steps to eradicate superstitions and other ill practices from our society-
Tell the people about the ill effects of superstitions on our health.
Try to develop scientific views in the people.
Make the people aware of how common people are deceived under the names of blind beliefs by so called Babas & Sadhus.
Make the people aware of the good things & bad things for the development of our society.
Take the help of the organizations working in the field of eradication of superstitions.
Arrange programmes to show the ill impacts of superstitions.
Try to develop scientific thinking within common people through practical experiences.
 

9) Listening helps in developing good relations with people. –

Listening is a skill which helps one to communicate successfully.
If we don’t listen to others and speak all the time, then people will get bored and try to avoid us.
A good listener is always alert and can judge things in correct perspective.
If we listen carefully what the person before us is saying, he / she will respect us.
Listening also helps us to sort out the misunderstanding.

Summary of the story

One morning a lift man in a city office, threw a passenger out of the lift. The passenger did not use the polite word, please. Instead, he ordered him to take to the top floor. The liftman wanted him to say – ‘top, please’ instead of just top. The passenger refused his demand. The lift man hurled him out of the lift. Later this lift man was fined accordingly.

The first and foremost requirement of Civility is that we should accept service by saying, ‘Thank you’ and ‘Please’ These little courtesies not only sweeten our life, but also make it run smoothly. A friendly request for a service is more workable than giving an order.

The author quotes an example of a polite bus conductor However, we find unpleasant bus conductors in rare cases. They regard the passengers as their staunch enemies. They Shout at the passengers and cheat them but a polite and cheerful bus conductor makes the journey easy and pleasant. One day the author boarded a bus in a hurry. He left home without any money in his pocket.

The conductor did not make a fuss. He rather booked him through he gave him the ticket not caring for the repayment of the money. Just then the author found a Shilling in his pocket. He settled the account. He even remained thankful to the conductor for his good-natured action. A few days later, while travelling, the author’s toe was trampled by the heavy boots of the same conductor.

His anger cooled down when the conductor apologized to him. A journey with that Noble conductor was a lesson in natural courtesy and good manners. If bad manners are infectious, so also our good manners. An uncivilized fellow leaves his imprint on us and we are likely to be rude. On the other hand, a cheerful fellow affects more like a fine day.

If the lift man would have tolerated the passenger politely. He would have gained victory. Not only on his enemy passenger but over himself also.

To be civil to others is a social practice. Though there is no law which compels us to say please, or thank you, there is a social practice which is more sacred than any law which expects us to be civil and to acknowledge a service. In the case of the lift-man, the passenger was being uncivil and rude to him. So, most people would sympathise with the lift-man.

During Chesterfield’s time, who was a famous writer, the streets of London were without pavements. Pedestrians had a tough time walking on the road. Those who were closest to the wall had the driest foot. Once a man who came from the opposite direction told Chesterfield that he never gave the wall to a scoundrel.

Chesterfield politely stepped aside saying that he always did. That was revenge enough, but done in a very apt yet a polite, civil manner. This was the spiritual victory achieved by Chesterfield.

Gardiner may be suggesting that just as the lift-man lost his patience and peace of mind. The conductor on the other hand remains morally upright. He is sensible enough to know when he has made a mistake and when he must apologize. Unlike the lift-man who has taken matters personally and as a result has broken the law.

This essay tells us the value of good manners. Bad manners are not a legal crime. But a man with bad manners is disliked by everybody. A liftman was punished for throwing an ill-mannered person out of the lift. The liftman was wrong because he had used violence. If a person is hurt physically, he can go to the law. Bad manners create a chain reaction, so do the good manners. So, we should reply bad manners with good manners.

Moral/Lesson

The courteous, sensitive bus conductor & his impact on the society-
The conductor would run upstairs in the rainy season to give someone the advice that there was place inside. He said sorry and was apologetic when the writer’s toe was trampled beneath his heavy boots.  He was as considerate as a son while dealing with old people. Dealing with children, he was as solicitous as a father. He indulged in some merry making while dealing with young people. Once he set down a blind man safely on the pavement and asked the driver to wait, till he helped him to cross the road.

Good temper is a quality that makes the surrounding pleasant. It is infectious. If we are good mannered, kind to others we will receive the same in return. The good-natured conductor was very modest. He was kind, sensitive, pleasant to his passengers & enlightened his own life.  

The Reasons for the passenger’s ill-mannered & rude behaviour-
It was a chain-reaction-

The house maid ‘answered back’ to the cook.

So, the cook was rude to the passenger’s employer’s wife.

The wife controlled, dominated the employer at breakfast.

The irritated employer did not wish ‘good morning’ to his employee- the passenger.

The passenger behaved rudely and impolitely with the lift-man.

The Reasons for the lift-man’s uncivilized behaviour-
i] The lift-man’s self-respect was hurt

ii] The passenger was rude.

iii] The passenger behaved in an uncivilized manner

iv] He declined to follow the lift-man’s demand of courtesy.

The Theme of the essay – On saying “Please”
The essay teaches the importance of civility, morality, courtesy, politeness, self-respect etc. We should be polite with the impolite, keep our peace of mind without lowering our self to the level of the perceived offender.

Good manners are also as infectious as bad manners. Just like the sunny weather that brightens up people’s spirits, good behaviour also brightens up the day. If we are civil, humorous towards others, we will get the same response from others.

A.G. Gardiner explores the theme of courtesy and the benefits of being courteous to others.

Difference between legal offence & moral offence
A legal offence is a punishable offence by law.  It is considered as a crime by the judiciary. Example – murder or robbery

A moral offence means action which is morally wrong. It differs from person to person. One person may find something morally offensive, other may not. This is not punishable by law. Example – being impolite, badmouthing, to box etc.

Prefix & Suffix
Prefix is a set of letters, which is usually used in front of a word. However, sometimes it changes the entire meaning of the word.

For example – discourage, impossible

Suffix is a set of letters that comes at the end of a word.

For example – establishment, connection",Himgiri variety of wheat,Hill bunt Leaf and stripe rusy,,,
,,,The cop and the Anthem,"A short Summary of –

The Cop and the Anthem by O Henry

“The Cop and the Anthem” is a short story by American author O. Henry. It describes the attempts of Soapy, a homeless man to get arrested, so that he’ll have a nice and warm place to stay over the winter – that is the jail. He is looking for an easy way to spend the winter. Rather than getting a job to earn money, his goal is to commit a minor crime that will surely land him in jail – “three months on the Island,” where he will have food and a warm place to stay.

The story begins with the introduction of the main character – Soapy and describes the conditions of his life, surrounding.

The story is of just one evening, but there are some flashbacks which describes the past life of Soapy. It seems that Soapy has a criminal past. Now, his home is a park bench.

The conflict of this story is the struggle between Soapy and Cop and between man and society.

Actually, there are two types of conflict in the story. The first is external, where the character- Soapy tries to hopelessly deal with several things. The second one is internal where he struggles with his own self.

Soapy wants to be caught by the Cop, so he takes a number of actions to achieve his goal to go to jail.

He decides to enter a luxurious cafe with the intention of eating a big, expensive meal. But he is immediately ejected by the head waiter because of the poor condition of his pants and shoes. Next, he attempts to get arrested by smashing a shop window, but is not suspected by the police as the real criminal. In a restaurant he eats stomach-ful & tells the waiter that he has no money. Instead of handing him over to police, two waiters punish Soapy by throwing him on the hard pavement.  Further he behaves noisily & disturbs the place to catch the attention of a policeman but is excused as one of the college students. Then he steals an umbrella in a cigar store, but the umbrella-man hesitates to call the cop standing right nearby as the umbrella- man admits that he had stolen the umbrella himself.

Soapy is unable to get himself arrested no matter how hard he tries. But as he fails in his attempts, there is a dramatic change of mood, ideas and his intentions.  All these events are related logically. Finally, Soapy stops outside a church. The climax moment is here when Soapy comes to this old church and after listening to the sweet organ notes of the anthem – (a song of hope), he begins to reflect himself. His ideas and opinion change drastically. Soapy stands on the street and considers his plans for his future. However, at this point, a policeman taps him on the shoulder and asks him what he is doing. When Soapy answers “Nothing,” his fate is sealed: he is arrested for loitering and is sentenced to three months to the island. He is ironically arrested, when he doesn’t want to be, and his original wish is thus granted.

The title of the story – In the title of the story, the cop is the cop who arrests Soapy for loitering. The anthem is the music being played by the organist inside the little church. There is supposed to be an ironic contrast between this two. The cop is Soapy’s antagonist and represents the law. While the anthem represents better side of Soapy and his desire to reform. Church anthems are always intended to inspire good thoughts in the listeners. This anthem had an especially strong transforming effect on Soapy because of all the troubles he had experienced on that cold day.

The message of the story is that every person has a story. Even the homeless man on the street has his own story, that may be different from his present state. There are references to his better past life but we are not told as to how or why Soapy became homeless. The writer teaches us to feel sympathy for him and to hope for better things when Soapy begins to plan a future for himself.

,,,The new Dress,"Introduction
This is the story of Mabel Waring and her yellow dress. Mabel receives an invitation to a party at Mrs Dalloway’s place. But her doubts about the dress keep her anxious throughout the little time she spends in the party. The writer’s technique of stream of consciousness allows us to peep into Mabel’s mind and follow her chain of thoughts.

Invitation to the Party
On receiving an invitation from Mrs Clarissa Dalloway, Mabel prepares to attend the party. She spends hours with the dressmaker to choose a dress. After much thought and elaborate discussion, she decides on a yellow dress. But as soon as she enters the party, a sense of self-doubt takes such a strong grip over her mind that she keeps wondering whether or not she looks good enough.

The Beginning of the Doubt
Mabel believes that to be fashionable in London society requires a good fortune. She believes she can never be fashionable. As soon as she enters Mrs Dalloway’s house, she meets Mrs Barnet. Mabel interprets the look on her face to be a look of disapproval of Mabel’s dress. Her confidence is shaken and on being greeted by the host of the party, Mabel grows more suspicious of her decision of wearing that dress. A final look into the mirror confirms that Mabel looks unfashionable and that her dress is not appropriate.

Mabel’s Past Life
Worrying so much over a dress seems a trivial matter until we get a peep into Mabel’s mind. Her thoughts reveal that her past life has not been easy. Mabel’s lack of confidence and her excessive self consciousness begin to make sense when we get to know the kind of childhood she had.

Money had always been scarce in her childhood and her family had struggled to make the two ends meet. A series of misfortune had aggravated the troubles of her poor family. Due to this, Mabel had never had an access to the high fashion of the society. Mabel’s married life had not made things any better and she lives in a small house with her husband Hubert and their two kids. They have no maids and can only afford bare minimum food.

The Cause of Mabel’s Insecurities
Mabel’s modest family background explains the sense of inferiority that constantly troubles her. However, she remains aware of the fact that the opinions of others or their approval should not be a matter of her concern. Despite knowing that she lacks conviction, she fails to free herself from the inferiority complex. This is because she has deeply ingrained the class differences that mark certain people as superior to others. She nevertheless tries hard to fit in into the high fashion society of Mrs Dalloway, but fails miserably.

The Fly in the Saucer
Mabel likens her condition to that of a fly trapped in a saucer. As much as she detests this image, it is stuck in her mind. She remembers having read it somewhere and the image of a fly trying to crawl over the edge of a saucer now seems like her own situation. Due to a lack of self-worth, she pictures herself as a poor, miserable fly while the other people at the party seem to her to be dragonflies, butterflies or beautiful insects. Mabel is so consumed by her insecurities that she sees herself as inferior to everyone.

Mabel’s Need for Validation
Dressed in her pale yellow silk dress, Mabel grows highly unsure and begins to suspect that people are mocking at her. She therefore initiates conversations with some people in hopes of getting a compliment or validation. Her anxieties are further heightened by guests like Charles Burt. Rose Shaw’s words of praise seem pretence to Mabel.

All praise seems mere pretence to her. Every compliment she receives is dismissed by her as merely an act of politeness. Seeing Charles Burt and Rose Shaw engaged in a conversation, Mabel assumes they are making fun of her yellow dress. She is further disconcerted by Mrs Holman who approaches her but talks only of her children’s ailments.

The Yellow Dot
Seated uneasily on a blue sofa, Mabel sees her reflection in a mirror. She sees herself as a yellow dot. This is the result of a complete absence of regard for herself and her worth, that makes her see herself reduced to mere dot. Her diminshed reflection in the mirror symbolises the incompetent and worthless person that Mabel has reduced herself to.

By constantly overthinking and doubting, she has begun to consider herself inferior to others like Rose Shaw or Mrs. Dalloway. She believes that she is an unsatisfactory mother and a wobbly wife.

Mabel’s Resolution
After a chain of conflicted thoughts trouble her during the party, she resolves to be a changed person and transform her life for better. But very soon, the determination fades away. Wrapped in her old Chinese cloak, Mabel Waring leaves the party early.

Conclusion
Mabel’s insecurities stem as much from her self-conscious thoughts as from her low social standing. She constantly feels out of place during parties but keeps attempting to fit in. She leads an unsatisfactory life at home and considers herself worthless. This is a woman trapped in the modern dilemma of identity. She dwells so much on her dress and cares too much for the opinions of others about herself.

Thus, Mabel Waring is an unfortunate figure who is the victim of her obsessive thoughts. She desperately tries to elevate herself to the social standing of the high class but fails. She is an alienated, lonely figure who is a victim of her own thoughts and of the class differences that she tries to efface.",B. Mutation Breeding :,,,,
,,,Into the Wild,"In this topic, the writer Kiran Purandare gives a thrilling account of his being lost in the jungle of Umbarzara. This excerpt is from his book ‘Sakha Nagzira’. The writer had come to this place for his research – to observe birds & note their behaviour.

 He had built a ‘hide’ to observe the birds without being seen. A hide is a shelter disguised by covering it to make it blend with the surroundings. It is mostly used by forest travelers & Wild Life researchers.

The writer had completed his day’s work. It was a tiresome eight & a half hour long day inside the hide. He describes himself as ‘being alone here as a fox.’ Fox is a solitary creature. The fox moves alone, and he has to be alert, every time. The writer was alone doing his research work in the forest. He took every precaution while moving in the jungle. In that dense forest, taking every step cautiously, he compares himself to a fox. He camouflaged his hide. i.e. he disguised it by covering it to blend with the surrounding. He scanned the area visually. He watched with wide-open eyes & tried to make minimal sound. He treaded cautiously among the leaves grasping various sounds.  

Suddenly he heard the langurs making alarm calls for the leopard.

‘Khyak! Khyak! Khyako Khyak!’

Langoor is a species of monkeys found in the forest. It gives alarm calls after spotting dangerous animals like leopards. Apart from the Langur’s alarm calls, the writer was aware of the presence of a leopard when he saw the fresh scat lying on the trail with bluish-purple flies hovering over it. He also heard the distant alarm calls of a four-horned antelope. He uses the expression ‘sanctum sanctorum’. It means a holy place where only a few are allowed to enter. The writer thinks that the leopard might have not liked his entry in his territory. He moved forward & the fading alarm calls made him clear that the leopard had moved away.

He walked further & met a villager with a stick in his hand, Raju Iskape – from Pitezari village. He had come to collect logs but had to retreat due to the presence of the leopard. The writer’s solitary visits to Umbarzara amazed him. Umbarzara was a haven not only for tigers but also for leopards & Sloth Bears.

They both took rest under a Kusum tree & resumed their walk. Raju went on his way. The writer followed the markings of the Forest Development Corporation. He kept moving through the forest. But after a while he was unable to find his way. The Sun was setting. The jungle would be completely in dark any minute. The writer had the sudden realization that he was lost in the jungle. He was nervous. He did not feel like eating anything. He had two bags with him. One was a Shabnam bag that contained the camera. The other small, colourful handbag had his tiffin.

All the familiar sounds of the birds & appearance of trees appeared alien to him. He was in despair having got lost in the jungle. To secure himself, the writer thought of climbing a treetop. His mind alerted him to turn back to the trail that he had left. He found dried up droppings of the Sloth Bear & resolved to move from there. There were a number of hillocks in front of the writer.

He ran frantically across a hillock & lo! He saw a bright red soil trail with the marks of a bicycle wheel on it. It indicated that a village was nearby. The writer who was frightened & desperate found this like a ‘silver lining’. The new found soil trail made the writer hopeful now of safely making it out of the jungle.

With trembling legs, he reached the top of the hill. He was able to hear the sounds of people. Quickly he ran towards the village & found droppings of the blue bulls nearby, sight of lantern of Rajiram Bhalavi’s farm & loudspeakers installed for Keshav Bhalavi’s marriage. He spotted the village lake & the familiar ‘Suihudaki’ hillock.

After reaching the village the first thing he did was to take a bath. He then had his food & took a nap.

He says ‘There still exists a jungle where we can get lost, isn’t this our good luck?’

He had gone through a terrifying experience of having lost in the jungle. It made him realize certain things. Humans have tried to take over the natural habitats of the wild life. Due to deforestation, there is barely any place left for humans to get lost in it. But the writer’s experience of getting lost in the jungle without any sign of human life shows that there are some places still untouched by humans. This realization made the writer feel that humans are lucky in a way. He finds positives from this experience.

,,,Why we Travel,"We come to understand that the terrains like mountainous or deserts which looks so pleasingaesthetically, are actually difficult places to live in. We are thereby prevented from thinking of them asmere abstractions. This way, we travel to rescue ourselves from such misconceptions.Travelling Enables Cultural ExchangeWhen a person travels, he takes along with him not only a luggage but also his beliefs and values. Thisenables a cultural exchange between travellers and the natives. The writer, for example, says that healways takes Michael Jordan posters to Kyoto and brings home woven ikebana baskets. Sometimes, it isnot only cultural artefacts but even dreams that get exchanged or transported in travelling.Travelling as a Return to Our True SelvesOur modern lives and the rat race for success corrupt our visions for life. But while travelling, we tend tocarry the basic minimum belongings with us. Hence, we discard all that does not seem essential. Thisway, we get rid of our obsession for material possessions.Travelling Makes Us Fall in Love with LifeThe writer says that as we travel, we are born again. By this he implies that travelling gives us newpurposes and motivation. We begin to appreciate life. Also, travelling brings out the child in a traveller.Thus, the experience of travelling gives us the innocent eyes with which we see the world anew andafresh. The writer believes that each time he returns after a tour, he keeps thinking of that place andrevisiting it through the photographs and his diary entries, just like a person in love.Adventure over MonotonyThe confines of our homes make life seem monotonous and dull. Travel provides the adventure andthrill that excites us. In the words of the great writer Albert Camus, “what gives value to travel is fear”.And this fear demands us to be more alert and active.Travelling Makes us Question the Fixity of IdentitiesWhile travelling, a person visits many places and meets many people. He absorbs certain elements ofvarious places and its people. One’s identity, therefore, does not remain fixed or singular. A travelleracquires a curious amalgam of identities of various languages and cultures. The writer quotes Sir ThomasBrowne who said that “We carry within us the wonders we seek without us.” This implies that we carrymultitudes within us and no human is confined to one singular identity.ConclusionThis way, Pico Iyer concludes that travelling is essential to keep the human mind active. It prevents thesoul from getting exhausted due to the boring routine of everyday life. It keeps a check on ourprejudices. Travelling reminds us that the world is too vast and complex, just like the vast expanse of thehuman inner self.
For life to remain interesting and for enthusiasm to never fade, it is important that one remainswakeful, receptive and willing to face the world in all its strangeness and unfamiliarity. Travellingachieves this end for us.","Mutation : It is a sudden heritable change in the genotype, caused naturally.",,,,
,,,Voyaging Towards Excellence,"Introduction
This is an autobiographical sketch by Achyut Godbole. He records his journey as an IT professional and then as a successful writer. His journey, with its ups and downs, is inspiring. Godbole also lists many qualities that he believes are essential for one to excel in any field of life.

Godbole’s Childhood:
The writer recalls that there was a scarcity of money and his family did not have some of the most basic amenities at home during his childhood. But he says that he was fortunate to have a culturally rich environment at home. His family hosted many artists at his home. Poets like Vinda Karandikar, Mangesh Padgaonkar and Vasant Bapat visited his home often.

As a child, the writer keenly listened to the discussions that went on for hours between these artists. Their conversations ranged from discussions about literature to music and even paintings. The writer grew curious about the world of knowledge that those people inhabited. Their conversations about both Marathi as well as English writers like Keshavsut, Mardhekar, Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy greatly impressed him.

There were discussions about the paintings of artists and sculptors like Van Gogh, Mozart and Michaelangelo. Among the many visitors were also the great musicians of his time, including Pt. Kumar Gandharv, Pt. Bhimsen Joshi and Pt. Jasraj. These visits and the conversations had a lasting impression on the writer and served as his initiation into the world of arts and humanities.

Interest in Science and Mathematics
Despite such a love for the arts, the writer also excelled in subjects of Science and Mathematics. He believes that it was the pleasure he derived from studying these subjects that made him perform well academically. He says that scoring more marks was never the motivation behind his interest in these subjects.

He studied Newton’s law of motion and the Pythagorean Theorem for their beauty and elegance. Thus, Science and Mathematics appealed to him not as academic subjects but as subjects that aroused his curiosity. This curiosity gave birth to an attitude of looking beyond the academic value of these subjects.

The writer thus developed an aptitude for problem-solving which helped him to clear his entrance exam and secure a place for himself in the esteemed IIT Mumbai. This was how a middle-class boy from Solapur made his way to IIT.

Struggle with English
The writer had been educated in Marathi. Therefore, he found himself incapable of conversing in English, unlike other people at IIT who spoke fluent English. An inferiority complex began to take hold on his mind and he even felt an urge to run away. An incident that took place in the hostel mess made him further anxious.

A senior student humiliated the writer for not knowing English. The writer felt utterly insulted but he also knew his worth. Thus, he resolved to learn English. Over a course of ten months, he taught himself English. He achieved this by consistent practice sessions in front of mirror and read newspapers and English novels. This filled him with a renewed sense of self-worth and confidence. This also proved greatly useful in future when he had to deal with international clients and negotiate contracts worth millions.

A Lesson in Humility
During the third year at IIT, the writer became a part of a group of intellectuals including IIT students and visiting professors in American universities. This exposed him to the vast sea of knowledge that he had not yet explored. He also understood that there were many people who possessed far more knowledge than he did.

This made him more humble. Then his encounters with some great thinkers and management gurus like Alvin Toffler, Peter Drucker, C. K. Prahlad and Tom Peters, further broadened the horizons of his thought process. His friend circle at IIT was also a group of curious young students who had not confined themselves to their professional fields only.

They took interest in other fields like Science, Technology, Sociology, Psychology, Economics, Philosophy, Anthropology, Archaeology, Political Science etc. This is how he delved into fields which were not part of his IIT curriculum but seemed important for what Godbole calls, the ‘examination of life’. His time in IIT taught him the value of curiosity, humility, humanity, team work and equality.

Godbole’s Career
Achyut Godbole had a 32 year long career in Information Technology, during which he occupied significant positions in many multinational companies. He then turned to what he calls his “first love” of reading and writing. This marked the beginning of his writing career. He has authored about 34 books in Marathi language and all of them have received favourable reception.

His books on subjects as diverse as psychology, science, management, mathematics, Indian and western music, literature and films have proved life changing to many readers. He believes that it is not the number of copies sold or the profits earned but the love and admiration of his readers that is primarily important to him.

Conclusion
Godbole’s journey concludes that scoring marks or earning more money should not be the only motivations for one to work hard. Knowledge should be considered important for knowledge’s sake. One should not be deterred by inferiority complexes but be determined to change them. A willingness to learn throughout one’s life is immensely important in one’s journey towards excellence.","Natural (physical) mutagens : High temperature, high concentration of C02, X-rays, UV rays.",,,,

The poet – Walt Whitman
Walt Whitman is an American poet. He is considered as the father of free verse. He was born in 1819 and grew up in the New York area. He had no formal schooling, but he considered himself to be a lifelong learner. Whitman died at the age of 72 in 1892.
The poem ‘Song of the Open Road’ is written in free verse. It is written in monologue form. The poet expresses his views on the journey of life taken on different roads. The unrhymed and varying length of lines suggest the complexities and the ups and downs one faces in life. It also indicates the poet’s inner desire to enjoy life to its fullest without bothering about the tensions and worries.
Walt Whitman strongly advocates importance of democracy & Freedom. It is an inspirational poem. This poem is an Ode to one’s self.

Explanation of the poem-

I Stanza-
“Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,
Healthy, free, the world before me,
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.”In these lines, Whitman is simply expressing happiness as he begins to walk the road. He starts his walk (“afoot”), with a light heart, which means, a happy heart that is free from the burdens of cares, stresses and sorrows. He takes off on this walk, with a happy heart. He is rejoicing in the fact that he is healthy, and able to do so. Not everyone can just take off walking when they have the desire; he can, and he rejoices in it.
He also feels free–he has the freedom to take a walk and enjoy it if he desires. As he goes on his walk, he is optimistic; he feels like he can accomplish anything. He expresses this sentiment through “the world is before me.” He feels like the world is his, there for him to enjoy. When he mentions “the long brown path before me,” he is simply referring to either the barren road that he is on, or a trail that he is following through the woods. And the last part, “leading me wherever I choose,” indicates once again his optimism; he can go where he wants, and he does, in full health and happiness.

II Stanza-
“Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,
Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,
Strong and content, I travel the open road”

The poet says that he does not have to pray for good luck because he is the maker of his own luck. He will no longer cry or hesitate to do what he wants because he is in need of nothing. He is no longer content with being walled inside; he is strong and happy to be on the open road. In line six, Whitman writes of “querulous criticisms.” The use of alliteration here emphasizes the speaker’s carefree tone. It is continued throughout the course of Song of the Open Road.

III Stanza-
“The earth, that is sufficient,
I do not want the constellations any nearer,
I know they are very well where they are,
I know they suffice for those who belong to them”

-The poet seems to separate himself from others. He says that the earth is fine the way it is. He does not desire to be any closer to the stars than he already is. He knows they are fine where they are, and he knows they are good enough for those who belong to them. In this line, the speaker emphasizes his free will and independence. He probably does not include himself in the group of people who belong to the constellations. He does not belong to them because he does not need them.

IV Stanza-
(Still I carry my old delicious burdens,
I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,
I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,
I am fill’d with them, and I will fill them in return.)

-The poet uses parentheses in this stanza to clarify certain things he has not mentioned in the first three stanzas. Here, the speaker admits that he is not without his own problems, but instead of running away from them, he relishes them. His use of the word delicious is intentional. In the second line of the final stanza, the speaker admits that he carries sweet burdens with him wherever he goes. This thought is continued in the final two lines of the poem. The speaker declares that he cannot rid himself of them; instead, he and his burdens share a symbiotic relationship: he is filled with his burdens, and in return, he fills them. The poet states here that his burdens do not define him; rather, he accepts them and carries them with him wherever he goes.

Summary –
The poem begins with poet’s journey on foot on the open road of life. He says that he is very cheerful to take the journey in this healthy and free world. In addition, the poet has a control over his journey as he is free to choose the brown path wherever to travel.
The poet continues to express his thoughts further by saying that he does not ask for good fortune. Instead he considers himself the creator of his own fortune. He adds that he will not cry or hesitate to do anything without postponing it and expects nothing. He is no longer satisfied in the four walls. He is strong enough and also happy to travel on the open road without any complaints and arguments from his past life.
In the next stanza, the poet tries to free himself from the worldly pleasures and relations. He has a great faith in his friends and knows that they are doing well and are happy. But he would now not like to engage himself in friends and other people as he believes that the mother earth is now enough for him to travel further.

Special features of the poem –
The poem is written in simple language. It is written in free verse. Length of the lines and stanzas are unequal. There are four stanzas. The first stanza contains only three lines, the other two stanzas contain four lines. In the last stanzas poet uses parentheses to indicate his separation from the worldly needs.
Phrases like ‘light-hearted’ and ‘querulous criticisms’ are wisely used.
Imageries such as constellations and brown colour are noteworthy.
Figures of speech such as Alliteration, Metaphor, Repetition and Paradox are impressive.
Traits exhibited – self-confidence, self-reliance, Independence, Clear thinking, Honesty, Self-acceptance, Optimism

He faces the life uncomplainingly and takes delight in travelling on the open road without any tension and worries of past, present and future and. The poet is determined to move ahead on the road of life with his own will and integrity. The Song of the open road also indicates & promotes freedom.

,,,The Indian Weavers,"Summary of the poem

The poem ‘Indian Weavers’ written by Sarojini Naidu, sums up the life of human beings in three main stages. The poet uses symbols of clothes & time of the day to explain this. According to the poet, the journey of life begins with blue colour. The colour blue indicates joy & happiness.

In the first stanza, the poet questions the weavers why they are weaving clothes so early in the morning. The clothes are blue like the wings of halcyon, which is the other name of the kingfisher bird. The weavers reply that they are weaving beautiful dress for new born child. There is similarity between the break of the day & birth of a baby. Both symbolize a new beginning. The blue colour symbolises something beautiful and precious. It also symbolises loyalty. Thus, the first stage of human life is full of happiness, freshness, hope, curiosity etc.

In the second stanza, the time described is the fall of night, that is when the sun sets. the poet questions the weavers why they are weaving clothes that are colourful like the feathers of peacock. The weavers answer that they are weaving the marriage veil of the queen. The poet thus refers the second- adult stage of life. At this stage, human beings are quite active, get married, shoulder responsibilities & struggle hard to live a better and a prosperous life.

In the third stanza, the weavers are sorrowful & silent. The poet finds them weaving something weird in the moonlight chill that is in the dead of the night. Whatever they are weaving is white as cloud or white as feather, symbolising the colourless life. The weavers tell the poet that they are weaving shroud for a dead person. Thus, the third and final stage of human life is death which is emotionless & colourless.

The words that express the changing mood of the poet are gay, bright, solemn & still.

The present condition of the weavers-

Many weavers in India are leaving the profession and shifting themselves to a new livelihood opportunity. Looking at the next generation there are only few to take up the activity. There is huge Increase cost of raw material. Co-operatives are shutting down due to no profit & all loss. Master weavers get the activity running at the cost of the weaver in the competitive market. Today the weavers are facing problems mainly because production done on power looms, are sold as handloom product. The fabric is offered for a very low price which handloom weaver or a cooperative society never can never compete with. There are several problems in the systems level, time constrain in the production process. So, there are many uncertainties faces by the weavers today.

,,,The Inchcpe Rock,"The Inchcape Rock
2.3 The Inchcape Rock – NOTES

Famous English poet Robert Southey has written this ballad. In the 14th Century, the Abbot of Aberbrothok installed a warning bell on the Inchcape Rock – an infamous sandstone reef located 18 km off the east coast of Angus, Scotland. The Inchcape Rock is submerged in water during high tide & is barely visible during low tide. This poem is about a sea-pirate – Sir Ralph the Rover, who removed the warning bell & later met his doom.

Summary –

The ballad opens with beautiful description of the calm atmosphere of the sea, air & the ship. The sea is calm & the waves gently pass over the Inchcape Rock without causing the Inchcape bell to ring. This rock was infamous for causing shipwrecks. There was a town situated on the North Sea coat in the council area of Angus, Scotland. The Abbot of Aberbrothok was a kind-hearted & selfless man. He had placed a bell on it to keep the ships safe from colliding with the rock.

On one shiny bright day, the birds joyfully sang over the sea. The installed buoy could be seen as a dark tiny spot over the green water of the ocean.  Sir Ralph the Rover – sea pirate noticed it from his ship. He was jealous of Abbot who was blessed by the sailors for his good deed. Sir Ralph the Rover was in a cheerful mood but his cheer & joy originated from wickedness. In a small ship, he rowed towards the Inchcape Rock & cut the bell off the float. The bell quickly sank into the sea. He was satisfied & commented that now onwards no shipmen would bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok as there was no bell left to guide them.

He then went in search of ships to plunder. After many days he returned towards Scotland’s shore. The day was rough. The strong winds had blown. Sir Ralph & his crew were not able to see the land as it was too dark. The waves crashing against the coast could be heard which indicated that that they were near the shore. Sir Ralph reassured his men that soon the moon will rise & provide some light on the sea.  One of his shipmen was confused about where they were. All wished if they could hear the bell sound. But that was not possible. Their ship rifted helplessly towards the dangerous Inchcape Rock that was submerged under water & struck hard against the rock. Sir Ralph the Rover hopelessly regretted for cutting the bell from the rock. The waves rushed from all sides & his ship sank into the water. He could hear the dreadful sound of the death bell that the devil below the sea rang with the Inchcape bell. He himself fell into the trap that he had set for others.  The poem confirms the universal truth that “What goes around, comes around”.



Character sketch of Sir Ralph The Rover-

Sir Ralph The Rover was an evil character. He was a sea pirate who becomes rich by looting other ships on the sea. He was overconfident & full of wickedness. He was jealous of the Abbot of Aberbrothok’s fame & reputation. He cuts the bell installed by him to warn the mariners from shipwrecks. He wish that this way no one will bless the Abbot for his good gesture & has no regret. It’s too late when in the end he realizes his mistake. He is a typical foolish villainous character.

,,,Have You Earned Your Tomorrow,"Summary of the poem
The poem ‘Have you earned your tomorrow?’ begins with two direct questions. The poet asks the readers if they have made someone’s day better and had nice conversation with other people so that they can remember them. The poet hints that time is running fast.  He asks if their good conduct with someone has made the other person say kind things about them, at the end of the day.

In the II stanza the poet further asks the readers if a friend who came face to face was greeted cheerfully or impolitely without bothering to show any concern. He wishes to know if the readers were selfish as they rushed through the day. This behavior is disapproved by the poet. He asks to recall whether the readers comforted someone & if the person was grateful to them for that gesture.

In the III stanza, the poet asks the readers if they were kind, at least to one single person whom they met that day. At least one person was given joy, made happy because of their actions and deeds. He wishes to know, whether any hopeless man was encouraged to lead a better future.

In the last stanza, the poet wishes to know how the entire day was spent. If the day was wasted or lost and spent unhappily without improving the lives of others. He wishes the readers to reflect upon their negative actions. If there was kindness shown to others, definitely it will urge these people to repeat the action to others. This will begin in creating a kindness chain, a kindness cycle throughout the world.

In the end, the poet asks the readers to recall by closing their eyes while sleeping and thinking about God’s reaction to their actions for the day. If the day was spent in doing kind deeds to others, God’s response will be a positive one. They can be assured of a better tomorrow. The good that is done today, definitely earns us our tomorrow. The good work we do today, assures us hopeful future.

,,,Father Returning Home,"2.5 Father Returning Home 

Explanation of the poem

Father returning home is an autobiographical poem written by Dilip Chitre (1938 – 2009).  He was born into a prominent literary family. Dilip Chitre,  a bilingual writer, writing in Marathi and English, is best known for his translations and revival of the Marathi Saint poet, Tukaram. Chitre was a writer, painter, translator, filmmaker and a teacher. Dilip Chitre once remarked, “Everyone is a minority of one”. Through this poem, the poet convincingly presents his idea that our singular experiences lead us to imagine that each of us is an isolated minority.

The poem has two stanzas of twelve lines each. The poet depicts the picture of his own father a Suburban commuter returning home from work. In the crowd also, he is all alone from inside. The poet has expressed feelings of regret for his father who has worked hard throughout his life. In spite of his lifetime hard work, he is neglected, uncared and ignored and has to spend a sad solitary life. The problems of old people who are by default compelled to undergo alienation and loneliness is highlighted throughout this poem. The first line contrastingly reveals, details of the father’s condition. ‘father travels on the late evening train’ – this line indicates that he has no personal method of transportation for his journeys and that the hour of that journey is late.

The narrator further creates a monotone atmosphere. The father is among silent commuters.  He has no will, desire, or energy to carry a conversation. This ‘silent’ quality reflects a level of alienation between the father and his surroundings. This alienation is a prominent concept of the poem.



The father stands among the silent commuters in the yellow light. Here the ‘yellow light’ represents the fear or fright of the father. The poet focusses on the sense of insecurity that is developing in our old generation who are being ignored and neglected by the youngsters.

‘Suburbs slide past his unseeing eyes’ – in this line ‘unseeing eyes’ indicate that the father is in deep thought, unaware of what is passing through’.

The father’s image on the train with ‘soggy’ clothes and a ‘black raincoat stained with mud’ is a defeated and sad visual.

Even ‘his bag stuffed with books falling apart’ showcase that no element of his current state is in good condition.  His bag is disintegrating under the heavy load of books. This is symbolic of his mental condition as well of his soul and body that longs for rest. His bag represents his physical state and it is he who is really mentally falling apart.

It is a rainy day,  as his shirt and pants are soggy and his black raincoat is stained with mud. The reference that he struggles to carry a bag stuffed with books, suggests that he might be into any academic profession.  He could be a teacher a professor or an editor or so. His father is keen to reach home as early as possible. He crosses the gray platform without wasting time. This is his daily routine. The gray platform is a symbol of his dull and colourless life.

Further the poet says that his father gets off the train like a word dropped from a long sentence. Here, the poet suggests that his father’s existence in this vast world is insignificant. His absence doesn’t matter to anyone at all. He crosses the track in a hurry, he wants to get away from the humid weather quickly and seek some comfort at home.

In the Second stanza the narrator describes his father in his home. Back home even, he is all alone. The narrator sees him drinking weak tea and eating a stale chapati. This indicates that he is deprived of good food and also has to suffer severe solitude. But his father does not have any complaints against it. Into the toilet, he thinks hard about the degradation of social values & relationships, and the isolation of man from man-made world. The indifference that he experiences in the outside world, he experiences the same at home also. He is well aware of his isolated state and may be quite fearful about it. He trembles while washing his brown aged hands. He trembles due to weakness which is physical but he also shivers at the thoughts of where the new society, generation is led to.  The lines – ‘a few droplets cling to the graying hair on his wrists’– indicate that he is just somehow holding onto his dull life.

The narrator describes the children as ‘sullen’ because they are different from the previous generation. They lack affinity & feelings. It is the trend of the modern generation. Children do not share a healthy relationship with the father. They do not share their joys and sorrows with him. There exists a communication gap which leads to a generation gap.  There is no connection, bond, attachment formed or created. Everything seems artificial and detached. Father is unhappy in his life, and the connection he desires with the children he loves is denied by those very children.  It also creates a line of division between the two generations within the household. The reference that the children have often refused to share jokes and secrets with him indicates that the father wants to be a part of their ‘jokes and secrets’ and that longing makes the division more heart-breaking.  What the father truly wants, seems out of his reach. He is miserable. There is a level of helplessness that is heightened.

The father does not find anything to look forward to, in his unexcited present life. Anyways, his father has set up his own routine. To compensate for all the loss, he listens ‘to the static on the radio’ as he goes to sleep. The radio does not receive a good signal due to the bad weather. ‘Static on the radio’ literally is just the hum of the radio. Nothing coming out in terms of music or radio show or anything. It’s just static and he uses the sound to learn to sleep and he dreams. This is typical of the elderly people, who rely on their past and future. The father has nothing  worthwhile to think of in the present. To get rid of his suffering, he turns to dreaming, dreaming about his past. He dreams about his ancestors and grandchildren. The ancestors and grandchildren represent the father’s past and future. In his dream he finds some solace in them from his present situation. This may be his own way to escape from the cruel reality.

The father finally finds rest and peace not on the train, not when he comes home, or when he is having his evening meal, but when he sleeps listening to the static over radio. This is extremely sad  and  the readers are left feeling nothing but sympathy for this father.",Mutant varieties :,,,,
,,,Money,"Money’ is the poem written by English Poet W.H. Davies. He was a Welsh poet , known as the ‘Tramp poet’.  All his poems and lyrics have a force and simplicity. In this poem, the poet presents his self-experienced wisdom that money makes the world go round. When the poet had money, he had a very big circle of friends. Many false friends would come knocking at his door. These friends used to often visit him as they thought that they could benefit from being with a wealthy man. But when he became poor, these so-called friends left him all alone. This made the poet realize that his big circle of friends was actually fake. And he recognized that the very few friends who did not leave him in his misery, were his true friends. In this way, he experienced the real worth of joy and happiness in spite of being poor.

The poet explains his idea by giving the example of a child holding a trumpet. The child is in possession of a trumpet but is unable to blow it, because of someone’s death. It is all-together against manners and custom to blow a trumpet when someone has died. Similarly, the poet feels that he was unable to tell about his realization to his false friends that true joy and happiness can be experienced only when one is poor. When he was rich, he lacked that much desired freedom, liberty. In the midst of his false friends, it was almost impossible for him to reveal it. Such was his miserable condition, when he was rich.

The poet further reveals his thoughtful wisdom, that poor men are happy and contented with their lives. They are happy from the bottom of their heart. They live a simple life. When their basic needs are fulfilled, they are happy. Their wives are seen busy taking pride in  talking about their husband’s work. Their husbands work day-night. And they are happy in the life, though it is full of poverty.

The poet says that he has often seen the poor people being happy and cheerful. This quality of the poor amazes him a lot. He feels that this is because their hearts are clear and pure. They do not chase wealth and are not pretentious. Contrast to this, the rich people are unfriendly, rude and constantly dissatisfied. Due to this, the poet is of the opinion that it is not necessary for the poor to become rich as necessary it is for the rich to become poor. The rich should become poor to understand the true richness of life. It is the philosophy of the poet that one can really understand and enjoy true happiness when one becomes poor.

The last stanza effectively highlights the theme of the poem that when one has money that means in prosperity, he has many friends, but they are unreal and false. And when he becomes poor, and is without money, he has few but real and true friends. It is the hard-earned self-experience of the poet that in spite of being  poor, he enjoys the richness of true friendship.

,,,She Walks In Beauty,"“She Walks in Beauty” Introduction
""She Walks in Beauty"" is a famous poem by British Romantic poet Lord Byron, first published in 1815. The poem praises and seeks to capture a sense of the beauty of a particular woman. The speaker compares this woman to a lovely night with a clear starry sky, and goes on to convey her beauty as a harmonious ""meeting"" between darkness and light. After its discussion of physical attractiveness, the poem then portrays this outer beauty as representative of inner goodness and virtue.

“She Walks in Beauty” Summary
The speaker compares a beautiful woman—who is walking—to a clear night sky full of bright stars. The finest light and darkness come together in harmony in this woman's appearance, particularly within her eyes. This gentle and delicate play of light is heavenly—indeed, heaven usually refuses to grant this supernatural light to the showy daytime.

A touch more shade or even one ray of light would have greatly diminished the woman's beauty. This beauty, which is hard to put into words, shows itself in every strand of the woman's hair, and gently falls on her face. Her sweet, angelic emotions play out on her face, revealing how pure and precious this woman is.

On the woman's cheek and forehead—softly and calmly, but noticeably—appear winning smiles and a glowing skin tone. These features reveal that the woman spends her days virtuously, that she possesses a peaceful mind, and that she has an innocent, loving heart.

“She Walks in Beauty” Themes
Theme Beauty and Harmony
Beauty and Harmony
As its title might suggest, “She Walks in Beauty” is a poem that praises a woman’s beauty. More specifically, it presents that beauty as a kind of harmony that is as perfect as it is rare. Indeed, that’s the main point of the poem—that this particular woman’s beauty is practically unparalleled because of the exquisite harmony and visual balance of her looks. Beauty, the poem thus suggests, is perfection achieved through harmony. And as the poem progresses, it makes clear that this harmony is delicate and fragile—potentially altered by even the smallest of changes.

The poem begins by establishing a sense of the speaker’s wonder at the woman’s majestic beauty. The speaker doesn’t say that the woman walks beautifully—but that she walks in beauty. This unusual construction helps with the sense that the woman’s beauty is truly remarkable, so vast and impressive that it seems to surround this woman like an aura or cloud. The poem quickly reveals what it believes to be the source of such beauty: the woman’s physical appearance brings together “all that’s best of dark and bright.” This suggests that beauty is a harmony between distinct elements—darkness and light. Beauty takes the “best” of these elements and places them in a delicate balance.

The poem then expands on this marriage of light and dark in stanza 2. Here, beauty is presented as almost beyond language, a “nameless grace.” The complex and intensely beautiful interplay between light (“ray[s]”) and dark (“shade”) is made possible only by the shape and contours of the woman’s physical appearance. This reinforces the idea that beauty is a kind of perfection achieved through harmony.

Part of the power of beauty is in its rarity. As lines 5 and 6 make clear, the woman’s harmonious beauty is not an everyday occurrence—this interplay of light and dark is the exclusive preserve of “heaven,” not the “gaudy day[s]” of life on earth. Beauty, then, also has an air of the divine or supernatural that contributes to this sense of rarity—comparable to sighting a comet or eclipse, perhaps. Furthermore, beauty is all-the-rarer because the harmony required for it to exist is so fragile. In the second stanza, the speaker outlines how even one shade—or one ray—out of place in the interplay of light and dark on the woman’s hair would upset her beauty; indeed, it would be “half impaired.”

It’s also worth noting that the common literary associations of darkness tend to be mystery and fear (in the works of Edgar Allan Poe, for example). Contrastingly, light is often linked to purity, beauty, and love (e.g., Carol Ann Duffy’s “Valentine” or Shakespeare’s “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”) The beauty in “She Walks in Beauty” depends on both light and dark, bringing them together in harmony. Accordingly, the woman’s beauty is all the more powerful and uncommon. “She Walks in Beauty,” then, is a poem that cherishes physical beauty and perfection. In the figure of the woman that it addresses, it sees an unparalleled example of perfect beauty and seeks to explain it, even though it may prove impossible to characterize its “nameless grace,” as a type of rare harmony that brings together light and dark.

Theme Inner Beauty vs. Outer Beauty
Inner Beauty vs. Outer Beauty
While “She walks in Beauty” primarily focuses on physical beauty, it also explores the relationship between inner beauty and outer beauty. It portrays these concepts as closely interconnected. Indeed, the woman’s outer appearance is read as a sign of her inner serenity, peacefulness, and innocence.

The poem develops a sense of physical beauty before introducing the idea that this type of beauty is linked to a person’s interior state. Lines 1-10 help the reader grasp just how rare and powerful this woman’s beauty is, which is further presented as a delicate—near impossible—balance between light and dark.

The poem then shifts, however, and begins to discuss the relationship between this outer loveliness and the woman's inner self. The woman’s face is portrayed as the site on which her thoughts are “expressed.” These thoughts, in turn, are characterized as “serenely sweet”; the poem maps the harmoniousness of the woman’s beauty onto her presumed inner state (that is, since she is so lovely, her thoughts must also be lovely). Indeed, the expression of her thoughts on her face serves to reinforce the purity and “dearness” (preciousness) of their “dwelling-place.” This could be interpreted as the thoughts reinforcing the woman’s outer beauty, or perhaps they speak of a kind of beauty that incorporates both physical appearance and personality/character.

The third stanza picks up on the development of lines 11 and 12, focusing on the relationship between inner and outer beauty. The speaker lists the woman’s fine features—her “cheek,” “brow,” “smiles,” and “tints” (skin)—and suggests that they express an inner goodness. In other words, her good looks are the sign of good virtues: the speaker believes that woman spends her days in “goodness,” has a peaceful mind, and a loving, innocent heart.

Outer beauty, then, becomes a symbol of inner beauty. Indeed, this inner beauty enhances the outer beauty because, if the outer beauty is linked to the woman’s facial expressions, these expressions are the result of inner emotions. Her outer beauty and inner “goodness” are in a kind of feedback loop, each intensifying the other.

Of course, it’s up to the reader to decide how much this idea convinces them. The poem spends most of its time focusing on physical beauty, and the reader learns little about the woman other than what the speaker tells them. Regardless, in the speaker’s opinion at least, outer beauty is a reflection of inner beauty—and indeed, both are in harmony with one another.

Line-by-Line Explanation & Analysis of “She Walks in Beauty”
Lines 1-2
The poem opens with the same words that form the title: ""She walks in beauty."" These four simple words quickly create an atmosphere of admiration and mystery. The reader gathers that the poem is, most likely, going to praise a woman's beauty. But this isn't a beautiful woman taking a walk, nor a woman walking beautifully—beauty is something that she walks inside of.

The caesura break after ""beauty"" allows the reader to consider what it means to be in beauty, as opposed to merely beautiful. That said, the meaning here is fairly ambiguous. It could be that the woman ""walks in beauty"" because, as a prime example of beauty, she is in a way at its gravitational center. In other words, beauty is drawn to her and surrounds her. This is supported by the idea in lines 3 and 4 (that ""dark and bright"" light are drawn to the woman's appearance). It could also be that her own beauty somehow makes the world around her more beautiful—like an aura of beauty that surrounds her as she walks. The contrast between ""night"" and ""starry skies"" also sets up the poem's central idea: that beauty is a kind of perfection achieved through harmony. In this particular case, it's specifically through a delicate balance of ""dark and bright.""

An already complicated sentiment is complicated further by the simile that follows. Either the woman, the way she walks, or beauty itself is compared to ""the night / of cloudless climes and starry skies."" It's a fairly elusive simile because it's not clear exactly which elements of the sentence are being compared—though arguably this heightens the sense of mystery around the woman's unparalleled physical beauty.

The poem also specifies a particular kind of night. These are nights when there isn't a cloud in the sky and the stars are shining bright. Here, then, the poem starts to develop its interplay of light and dark—an antithesis that is resolved in the beauty of the woman. The heavy alliteration (and sibilance) here is deliberately ornamental and decorative, and is meant to suggest physical beauty:

Of cloudless climes and starry skies;

Also worth noting is the way in which the first two lines are paired together through enjambment—they are part of the same sentence. Line 2 is then end-stopped, further reinforcing the sense that the first two lines make a distinct pair. This is quite common in the poem and is suggestive of the idea of beauty as a kind of harmony or perfection—the two lines joining to make each other complete.

“She Walks in Beauty” Poetic Devices & Figurative Language
Alliteration
""She Walks in Beauty"" makes frequent use of alliteration. For the most part, the alliteration is meant to reflect beauty on a linguistic level. In other words, the alliteration helps the poem itself sound beautiful to match the fact that it is talking about beauty. Indeed, it's quite ornate, even showy at times. It draws the reader's attention to the fact that this is capital-P Poetry.

The first example of alliteration is in line 2: ""cloudless climes and starry skies."" The alliteration here is not subtle, and forms two obvious pairs—the hard /c/ sound and the /s/ sound (which is specifically an example of sibilance). As the poem intends to establish beauty as a kind of perfection achieved through harmony (in this case, between light and dark), the pairing-off of sounds creates a sense of harmoniousness; in other words, the sounds—two /c/ sounds in a row followed by two /s/ sounds in a row—create a sense of balance and symmetry.

The next key example is between lines 4 and 5, with ""Meet"" and ""mellowed."" ""Meet"" is a stressed syllable, which opens the line with a trochee and upsets the poem's iambic tetrameter:

Meet in her aspect and her eyes

This stress makes the word ""Meet"" sound particularly prominent, allowing for the alliteration between this and ""mellowed"" to ring out despite the relatively wide distance between these two words. ""Mellowed"" in turn shows the reader what happens when the ""best of dark and bright / Meet"" in the appearance of the woman. As such, cause is linked with effect through sound.

Line 9 has alliteration through the phrase ""Which waves,"" which is part of the stanza's broader heavy use of consonance, assonance, and sibilance. All of these techniques function as ornamentation, intended to make the stanza sound ""prettier"" in order to reflect the woman's beauty.

Form, Meter, & Rhyme Scheme of “She Walks in Beauty”
Form
""She Walks in Beauty"" has a simple and regular form. It is comprised of three six-line stanzas, a.k.a. sestets, all of which are iambic tetrameter.

Each sestet serves a slightly different purpose in developing the poem's discussion of beauty. The first is simply to establish the beauty of the poem's subject: a woman seen by the speaker. The speaker develops the idea that beauty is a form of perfection achieved through harmony, particularly in this case through the ""meeting"" of darkness and light. The rarity of this harmony is also established through the mention of heaven—this is not an everyday, ""gaudy"" beauty.

The second stanza portrays this beauty as delicate and fragile. Even a slight change to the light—one shade more or one ray less—would greatly diminish this beauty. Line 11 marks a shift in the poem in which the discussion moves beyond physical appearance and starts to consider inner beauty too.

The third stanza picks up on this idea, honing on the individual features of the woman's face and building a composite picture that speaks of inner goodness, peace, and love. In other words, the woman's physical attractiveness is read by the speaker as signal of an equally beautiful interior state. The poem builds to its rhetorical height, denoted by the final—and only—exclamation mark.

Meter
""She Walks in Beauty"" has a regular metrical scheme throughout: iambic tetrameter. This means there are four poetic feet per line, each consisting of a da DUM syllable pattern.

Looked at broadly, perhaps it is fitting that the poem is so regular in terms of meter, stanza shape, and rhyme—together, these traits denote a sense of order, harmony, and symmetry befitting the type of rare beauty the poem attempts to describe. On another general point, it's worth remembering that iambs are often associated with walking. Their steady groups of two syllables mimic the alternating combination of left foot and right foot—indeed, extending the analogy further, people themselves have one stronger and one weaker foot (just as the iamb has a stronger and weaker syllable). The way this steady rhythm evokes the woman's walk is evident from the beginning:

She walks in beau-ty, like the night
Of cloud-less climes and star-ry skies;

In fact, there is only one deviation from this metrical regularity throughout the whole poem. This happens in line 4, when the line uses a trochee (stressed-unstressed, basically the opposite of an iamb) in the first foot. This places sudden and dramatic stress on the verb ""Meet,"" which helps creates the sense of ""dark and bright"" being forced together:

Meet in her as-pect and her eyes;

Rhyme Scheme
The rhyme scheme in ""She Walks in Beauty"" is highly regular, with each six-line stanza following a pattern of:

ABABAB

Apart from the slight slant rhyme of ""brow,"" ""glow,"" and ""below,"" in the third stanza, these are all strong, perfect rhymes.

Generally speaking, the neatness of the rhyme scheme is intended to create a sense of harmony and symmetry. Given that one of the poem's main ideas is that beauty is a kind of perfection achieved through harmony, it makes sense that the rhymes would ring out so clearly and cleanly.

Furthermore, the fact that each stanza uses only two different rhyme sounds helps to mirror the poem's central antithesis between light and dark. Each stanza is a kind of fusion between these two different rhyme sounds, just as the woman's beauty brings together the ""best of dark and bright.""

“She Walks in Beauty” Speaker
The speaker in ""She Walks in Beauty"" is not specified—given no name, age, occupation, nor gender. This adds to the universality of the poem and suggests that anyone would be able to appreciate this woman's beauty. That said, it's also worth noting that the Lord Byron himself is often equated with the poem's speaker. So the story goes, the poem was written after a party Byron attended at which he saw a particularly beautiful woman (who was the wife of his cousin).

In any case, the speaker is a person preoccupied by a contemplation of beauty, physical or otherwise—though perhaps mostly physical; it's not until past the poem's midway point that the speaker starts to discuss the woman's inner beauty.

“She Walks in Beauty” Setting
""She Walks in Beauty"" doesn't really have a particular sense of location or place. Primarily, it takes place in the mind of the speaker, who is trying to understand the astonishing beauty of a particular woman. The poem does evoke a kind of setting, mentioning a clear and starry night in the opening lines and ""tender light"" later in the stanza. There is a certain atmosphere, then, one which is constructed on a kind of gentle and delicate light—but it's not really wedded to a particular location. The poem also casts a kind of microscopic gaze on the woman's outer appearance, making this is a part of the setting too.

Literary and Historical Context of “She Walks in Beauty”
Literary Context
Lord Byron—George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron to be precise—is one of English literature's most infamous figures. He was part of the British Romantic poets, in particular the second generation (along with Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats). This particular poem was published in his collection Hebrew Melodies (1815), which was originally intended to be set to music (which perhaps is reflected in the simplicity of the poem's meter).

Though Byron is now considered one of the English language's foremost poets, his early forays into the literary world were not very successful. Indeed, his first volume of poetry was slammed by the critics. Byron got his own back on the literary establishment by publishing his satire, ""English Bards and Scotch Reviewers"" (1809), which took aim at contemporaries like William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge (a move that he re-evaluated later in life).

Byron does have a number of aspects in common with the usual associations of Romanticism. These include political engagement, extensive travel, and a taste for freedom. That said, he occupies in a place in Romanticism like no other. After publishing his long poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Byron became a celebrity on a scale that was practically unknown at the time. That poem saw the genesis of the ""Byronic hero,"" a well-educated, cunning, and charming man who has a disdain for authority. Many readers saw Byron himself as the archetype for this hero.

Historical Context
Byron lived during an age of considerable upheaval. For one thing, he was born on the cusp of the French Revolution, when French citizens overthrew the country's absolute monarchy and showed the rest of Europe how formidable the people, when banded together, could be. The French Revolution, initially at least, was well-received in some quarters in Britain; William Wordsworth, another Romantic poet, praised it in his Prelude: ""Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive."" Not long before the French Revolution, America had also rebelled against its colonial British rulers. Finally, the late 18th and early 19th century also marked the First Industrial Revolution in England, a time of widespread societal change spurred by new technologies and manufacturing processes.

Byron also strongly admired Greek culture and Byron supported the Greeks in their attempts to win independence from the Ottoman Empire. He spent much of his personal fortune on improving the conditions of Greek ships and soldiers. The Greek side had a number of internal conflicts, with Byron sometimes acting as mediator. It was in Greece that he died in 1824 at the age of 36 from fever.

,,,Small Towns and Rivers,"The poem portrays the river as a source of life and inspiration, carrying with it the memoriesand stories of generations of people who have lived alongside it. The speaker of the poem isdeeply connected to the river and its surroundings, and feels a sense of wonder andreverence towards the natural world. The river is also seen as a symbol of the region'scultural heritage, as it has been a part of the people's lives for generations.The river is alsoseen as a symbol of continuity and change in the poem.Mortality and ImmortalityThe main themes of this poem are the cycle of birth and death, nature, spirituality, theafterlife, and the idea of immortality.The aspects of nature are used as symbols to the theme of life and immortality. It is alsointeresting to note that the trees are known for being living, breathing species, yet theysurround a town which reminds the poet of death. This duality symbolises life and death–nature symbolises life, while the town symbolises death. When one person died, the entiretown mourned the loss together. This stanza introduces the idea of immortality, as well- butwhat is immortal is not the person, only the rituals. “millions of people are born and then they die, and we never know when or where or how itmay happen. But if one thing is permanent, it is the rituals, for they are followed throughoutgenerations. Life and death are natural processes; hence they are always changing.However rituals, which are man-made processes, remain the same. This is similar to theway the town, a man-made structure, remains the same. This is the difference between theriver’s permanence and the town’s- the town is a sedentary constant, while the river is amoving one. We are also introduced to one type of immortality: the undying nature.SpiritualityThe theme of spirituality as Dai talks about the soul and its life after the body’s death. Sheacknowledges that everybody from these towns have the aim to walk with the gods, whichmeans that they all wish to live peacefully and happily in the afterlife. This is the finalelement of immortality in the poem- rather than the soul entering a new body, it travels to theheavens and walks with the Gods. This provides a rather hopeful conclusion to the poem.Life and death is a continuous cycle in the midst of nature, but the end may not be asterrifying as one believes. For the soul will replenish in the sunlight and find a new source oflife, whether it is nature, a body on the earth, or the afterlife",Wheat : NP 836 (rust resistant),,,,

,,,Around The World In Eighty Days,"Around the World in Eighty Days, travel adventure novel by French author Jules Verne, published serially in 1872 in Le Temps and in book form in 1873. The work tells the story of the unflappable Phileas Fogg’s trip around the world, accompanied by his emotional valet, Passepartout, to win a bet. It was the most popular of Verne’s Voyages extraordinaires series of novels.

Summary
Phileas Fogg, a London gentleman of meticulous and unchanging habits, hires as his valet Jean Passepartout, a Frenchman who has had a variety of jobs, including circus performer, but now seeks a tranquil life. After reading in The Daily Telegraph that a new railroad in India has made it theoretically possible to travel around the world in 80 days, Fogg bets his fellow members at the Reform Club that he will make that journey in 80 days or less; the wager is for the princely sum of £20,000 (half his fortune). Leaving that night, Fogg and a nonplussed Passepartout board a train bound for Dover and Calais to begin their journey.

Shortly before Fogg’s departure, someone resembling him had robbed a bank, and Fogg’s sudden exit leads Scotland Yard to believe that he was the bank robber. Accordingly, a detective, Mr. Fix, is sent to Suez, in British-ruled Egypt, to await the steamer Mongolia, on which Fogg and Passepartout are traveling. Fix befriends Passpartout, and, after learning that they will take the steamer to Bombay, he buys a ticket and joins them. The Mongolia reaches Bombay before the arrival of an arrest warrant, however. During the few hours before their planned departure for Calcutta on the Great India Peninsula Railway, Passepartout visits a Hindu temple on Malabar Hill, unaware that Christians are forbidden to enter and that shoes are not to be worn inside. He is beaten by enraged priests and barely makes it to the train station on time.
The train travels through India until stopping at the village of Kholby, where Fogg learns that, contrary to what was reported in the British press, the railroad is 50 miles (81 km) short of completion, and passengers are required to find their own way to Allahabad to resume the train trip. Fogg purchases an elephant and hires a Parsi man as elephant driver and guide. The elephant-borne party later encounters a group of people preparing for an act of suttee—the immolation of a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre. Fogg decides that they must rescue the young widow. Passepartout disguises himself as the body of the late rajah, and, as soon as the pyre is lit, he springs up and seizes the widow. The party then flees before the ruse is discovered. They reach the railroad station in Allahabad and continue on their journey.

In Calcutta, however, Fogg and Passepartout are arrested and sentenced to prison because of Passepartout’s incursion into the Malabar Hill temple in Bombay. An unperturbed Fogg pays bail for them, and, accompanied by the widow, Aouda, they board a steamer bound for Hong Kong. Fix, who had hoped the sentences would keep them in Calcutta long enough for the warrant to arrive, joins them.

In Hong Kong Passepartout attempts to secure cabins on a boat to Yokohama and learns that its departure has been rescheduled for that evening. Desperate to keep Fogg in Hong Kong until the warrant arrives, Fix tells Passepartout why he is following Fogg and offers to pay him to help delay Fogg’s departure. When Passepartout refuses, Fix drugs him with opium, preventing him from returning to Fogg. As a result, Fogg misses the steamer. However, he finds another ship that will take them to Shanghai, and he, Aouda, and Fix set sail. In the meantime, Passepartout manages to stagger onto the ship for Yokohama.

Passepartout arrives in Yokohama with no money and no idea where Fogg is. He joins a traveling circus, where Fogg, having caught a Yokohama-bound steamer from Shanghai, encounters him just in time for them all (including Fix) to board the steamer that will take them to San Francisco. As Britain has no jurisdiction in the United States, Fix is now as eager as the rest of them to get Fogg back to England quickly. The group boards a train bound for New York City.

The train trip continues more or less uneventfully until it reaches Medicine Bow, Wyoming Territory, where a signalman tells them that the suspension bridge is too dilapidated to bear the weight of a train. However, the engineer believes that it might be possible to safely cross the bridge by going at top speed, and the plan works, with the bridge collapsing as soon as the train reaches the other side. In Nebraska the train is attacked by a band of Sioux, who are on the point of winning the battle when Passepartout succeeds in uncoupling the train from its engine outside Fort Kearny, and the soldiers garrisoned there frighten the Sioux into leaving. However, the Sioux capture Passepartout and two other passengers. Fogg rides to their rescue with a group of soldiers, but the recoupled train departs without them.

Using a sail-powered sledge, Fogg and the others travel over snow to Omaha, Nebraska, arriving just in time to board a train to Chicago. From there they catch a train to New York City, where they arrive 45 minutes after departure of the ship to England. Fogg finds an empty trading ship whose captain is willing to carry the group of four to Bordeaux, France. After bribing the crew and imprisoning the captain, Fogg assumes control and sets course for Liverpool, England. When a storm prevents the use of sails, the coal supply runs low. Fogg buys the ship from the captain and begins burning its wooden parts. As soon as they arrive in Liverpool, Fix arrests Fogg. Several hours later, though, Fix learns that another man was responsible for the bank robbery, and he releases Fogg, who orders a special train. However, he arrives in London five minutes too late to win his wager.

The following evening Fogg apologizes to Aouda for being unable to provide for her comfort as a result of losing the bet. She in turn proposes marriage to him, and he joyfully agrees. Passepartout is sent to engage a clergyman, and he learns that their journey through the time zones had gained them a day and that they are not too late after all. He rushes back to notify Fogg, who arrives at the Reform Club with only moments to spare.

Response and adaptations
The richness and poetry of Around the World in Eighty Days, together with the lively narrative, won Verne worldwide renown and was a fantastic success for the times, setting new sales records, with translations in English, Russian, Italian, and Spanish appearing soon after it was published in book form. An 1874 stage version, written by Verne and French playwright Adolphe d’Ennery, was also wildly successful and ran for several decades. The novel inspired numerous attempts to travel around the world in 80 days or less, most notably by American journalist Nellie Bly in 1889–90.","Cabbage : Regina-II (resistant to bacterial rot), etc.",,,,

A principle is a fundamental statement of truth that provides guidance to thought and action.

Principles of Management

Principles of management are broad and general guidelines for managerial decision making and behavior (i.e. they guide the practice of management).

Nature of Principles of Management

The nature of principles of management can be described in the following points:

1. Universal applicability i.e. they can be applied in all types of organizations, business as well as non-business, small as well as large enterprises.

2. General Guidelines: They are general guidelines to action and decision making however they do not provide readymade solutions as the business environment is ever changing or dynamic.

3. Formed by practice and experimentation: They are developed after thorough research work on the basis of experiences of managers.

4. Flexible: Which can be adapted and modified by the practicing managers as per the demands of the situations as they are man-made principles.

5. Mainly Behavioural: Since the principles aim at influencing complex human behaviour they are behavioural in nature.

6. Cause and Effect relationship: They intend to establish relationship between cause & effect so that they can be used in similar situations.

7. Contingent: Their applicability depends upon the prevailing situation at a particular point of time. According to Terry, “Management principles are ‘capsules’ of selected management wisdom to be used carefully and discretely”.

Significance of the Principles of Management

The significance of principles of management can be derived from their utility which can be understood from the following points:

1. Providing managers with useful insights into reality: Management principles guide managers to take right decision at right time by improving their knowledge, ability and understanding of various managerial situations and circumstances.

2. Optimum utilization of resources and effective administration: Management principles facilitate optimum use of resources by coordinating

the physical, financial and human resources. They also help in better administration by discouraging personal prejudices and adopting an objective approach.

Fayol’s Principles of Management

About Henry Fayol: Henry Fayol (1841-1925) got degree in Mining Engineering and joined French Mining Company in 1860 as an Engineer. He rose to the position of Managing Director in 1988. When the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. He accepted the challenge and by using rich and broad administrative experience, he turned the fortune of the company. For his contributions, he is well known as the “Father of General Management”.

Principles of Management developed by Fayol

1. Division of work: Work is divided in small tasks/job and each work is done by a trained specialist which leads to greater efficiency, specialization, increased productivity and reduction of unnecessary wastage and movements.

2. Authority and Responsibility: Authority means power to take decisions and responsibility means obligation to complete the job assigned on time. Authority and responsibility should go hand in hand. Mere responsibility without authority, makes an executive less interested in discharging his duties. Similarly giving authority without assigning responsibility makes him arrogant and there is fear of misuse of power.

3. Discipline: t is the obedience to organizational rules by the subordinates. Discipline requires good supervisors at all levels, clear and fair agreements and judicious application of penalties.

4. Unity of Command: t implies that every worker should receive orders and instructions from one superior only, otherwise it will create confusion, conflict, disturbance and overlapping of activities.
Principles of Management class 12 Notes Business Studies
5. Unity of Direction: Each group of activities having the same objective must have one head and one plan. This ensures unity of action and coordination.
Principles of Management class 12 Notes Business Studies
Difference between Unity of Command and Unity of Direction

Basis	Unity of Command	Unity of Direction
1.Meaning	It means that a subordinate should receive orders and instructions from one boss only.	It advocates ‘one head, and one plan‘ for a group of activities having the same objectives. The activities should be directed towards the common goals.
2.Scope	This principle is related to the functioning of personnel	This principle is related to the functioning of a department or the organization as a whole
3.Purpose	The main purpose of unity of command is to avoid confusion and fix up the responsibility of the employee.	The purpose of unity of direction is to direct the efforts of employees of one department in achieving the main objective of that department.
4.Results in	Systematic working and improved efficiency by removing confusion and chaotic conditions	Co-ordination within a particular department and overall; by preventing overlapping of various activities.
7. Remuneration of Employees: The overall pay and compensation should be, fair to both employees and the organization. The wages should encourage the workers to work more and better.6. Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest: The interest of an organization should take priority over the interest of any one individual employee.

8. Centralization and Decentralization: Centralization means concentration of decisions making authority in few hands at top level. Decentralization means evenly distribution of power at every level of management. Both should be balanced as no organization can be completely centralized or completely decentralized.

9. Scalar Chain: The formal lines of authority between superiors and subordinates from the highest to the lowest ranks is known as scalar chain. This chain should not be violated but in emergency employees at same level can contact through Gang Plank by informing their immediate superiors.
Principles of Management class 12 Notes Business Studies
10. Order: A place for everything and everyone and everything and everyone should be in its designated place. People & material must be in suitable places at appropriate time for maximum efficiency.

11. Equity: The working environment of any organization should be free from all forms of discrimination (religion, language, caste, sex, belief or Basis Unity of Command Unity of Direction nationality) and principles of justice and fair play should be followed. No worker should be unduly favoured or punished.

12. Stability of Personnel: After being selected and appointed by rigorous procedure, the selected person should be kept at the post for a minimum period decided to show results.

Taylor’s Scientific Management

Fredrick Winslow Taylor (1856-1915) was a person who within a very short duration (1878-1884) rose from ranks of an ordinary apprentice to chief engineer in Midvale Steel Company, U.S.A. Taylor conducted a number of experiments and came to conclusion that workers were producing much less than the targeted standard task. Also, both the parties – Management and workers are hostile towards each other. He gave a number of suggestions to solve this problem and correctly propounded the theory of scientific management to emphasize the use of scientific approach in managing an enterprise instead of hit and trial method. For his contributions, he is well known as the “Father of the Scientific Management”. Scientific Management attempts to eliminate wastes to ensure maximum production at minimum cost.

Principles of Scientific Management

(1) Science, not rule of Thumb: There should be scientific study and analysis of each element of a job in order to replace the old rule of thumb approach or hit and miss method. We should be constantly experimenting to develop new techniques which make the work much simpler, easier and quicker.

(2) Harmony, Not discord: It implies that there should be mental revolution on part of managers and workers in order to respect each other’s role and eliminate any class conflict to realize organizational objectives.

(3) Cooperation not individualism: It is an extension of the Principle of Harmony not discord whereby constructive suggestions of workers should be adopted and they should not go on strike as both management and workers share responsibility and perform together.

(4) Development of each and every person to his or her greatest Efficiency and Prosperity: It implies development of competencies of all persons of an organization after their scientific selection and assigning work suited to their temperament and abilities.

1. Functional Foreman-ship: Functional foreman-ship is a technique in which planning and execution are separated. There are eight types of specialized, professionals, four each under planning and execution who keep a watch on all workers to extract optimum performance.

Planning Incharges:

1. Route Clerk to specify the exact sequence and route of production.

2. Instruction card clerk is responsible for drafting instructions for the workers.

3. Time and cost clerk to prepare time and cost sheet for the job.

4. Shop Disciplinarian to ensure discipline and enforcement of rules and regulations among the workers.

Production Incharges:

1. Gang boss is responsible for keeping tools and machines ready for operation.

2. Speed boss is responsible for timely and accurate completion of job.

3. Repair boss to ensure proper working conditions of tools and machines.

4. Inspector to check quality of work.

2. Standardization and Simplification of work: Standardization refers to developing standards for every business activity whereas Simplification refers to eliminating superfluous varieties of product or service. It results in savings of cost of labour, machines and tools. It leads to fuller utilization of equipment and increase in turnover.

3. Method Study: The objective of method study is to find out one best way of doing the job to maximize efficiency in the use of materials, machinery, manpower and capital.
(1) Which technique of scientific management is being violated here?
(Hint: Functional Foreman ship.)
(2) Write one consequence of this violation.

4. Motion Study: It is the science of eliminating wastefulness resulting from using unnecessary, ill-directed and inefficient motions by workers and machines to identify best method of work.

5 Time study: It determines the standard time taken to perform a well-defined job. The objective of time study is to determine the number of workers to be employed, frame suitable incentive schemes & determine labour costs.

6. Fatigue study: Fatigue study seeks to determine time and frequency of rest intervals in completing a task. The rest interval will enable workers to regain their lost stamina thereby avoiding accidents, rejections and industrial sickness.

7. Differential piece wage system: This system links wages and productivity. The standard output per day is established and two piece rates are used: higher for those who achieve upto and more than standard output i.e. efficient workers and lower for inefficient and slow workers. Thus, efficient workers will be rewarded & inefficient will be motivated to improve their performance.

For example: Standard task is 10 units. Rates are: Rs 50 per unit for producing 10 units or more and Rs 40 per unit for producing less than 10 units
Worker A produces 11 Units; he gets Rs 550 (11 units x 50 per unit)
Worker B produces 09 units; he gets Rs 360 (9 units x 40 per unit)
This difference of Rs 190 will motivate B to perform better.

,,,Functions of Management,"The Function of Management is planning, organising, directing, and controlling the efforts of people in an organisation and using resources to achieve specific goals. This process includes a set of functions that managers perform to achieve goals. Management is important in helping an organisation reach its targets, such as maximising profits and increasing market share.


The functions of management form the foundation for effectively running organisations and achieving goals efficiently. These functions, established by Henri Fayol, encompass five key activities:


Planning: Planning means deciding in advance what needs to be done and who will do it. It involves setting goals and finding effective ways to achieve them. For example, A family plans a picnic. They decide where to go, what food to pack, and who will bring what items to make the outing enjoyable.

Organising: Organising involves arranging tasks, assigning duties, and allocating resources to execute a plan. Once the plan is ready, the organising team identifies what needs to be done, what resources are required, and who will perform each task. It ensures that all tasks are clearly defined and coordinated.

Staffing: Staffing is about finding the right people for the right jobs. It ensures that skilled individuals are available at the right time and place to help the organisation meet its goals. This includes activities like hiring, training, and placing employees in suitable roles.

Directing: Directing means guiding, leading, and motivating employees to complete their tasks. It involves creating a positive work environment where employees feel encouraged to perform well. Key aspects include communication, motivation, and leadership, all of which inspire employees to work towards the organisation's goals.

Controlling: Controlling ensures that the organisation stays on track to meet its objectives. It involves setting performance standards, measuring actual performance, comparing it with the standards, and taking corrective action if needed. Managers decide what to monitor, how to measure progress, and who will take action if things deviate from the plan.


7 Functions of Management
The 7 functions of management build on the traditional 5 functions by adding more important tasks for today’s organisations.


1. Planning  
Deciding in advance what needs to be done, setting goals, and determining the best way to achieve them.


Example: A shop plans to open a new branch and decides on its location, budget, and timeline.


2. Organising  
Arranging resources, assigning tasks, and ensuring everything is in place to execute the plan.


Example: A company assigns teams for marketing, production, and sales for a product launch.


3. Staffing
Recruiting, training, and placing the right people in the right roles.


Example: A hospital hires doctors, nurses, and support staff, ensuring they are well-qualified for their jobs.


4. Directing  
Guiding and motivating employees to perform their tasks effectively.


Example: A team leader motivates employees with clear instructions and rewards for good performance.


5. Controlling
Monitoring progress, comparing it with the plan, and taking corrective actions if needed.


Example: A factory manager checks daily production levels and fixes issues if targets are not met.


6. Coordinating
Ensuring all departments and activities work together smoothly towards common goals.


Example: An event organiser coordinates between the decoration, catering, and entertainment teams to ensure the event runs smoothly.


7. Reporting
Keeping management and stakeholders informed about the progress and performance of tasks.


Example: A project manager prepares weekly reports to update the client on the project's status.


Evolution of Management Functions
Contributions of Henri Fayol
Henri Fayol's five primary management functions—Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, and Controlling—laid the foundation for modern management. His 14 Principles of Management emphasised universal applicability and systematic approaches to organisational leadership.


Comparison with Mintzberg's Managerial Roles
Mintzberg offered a dynamic perspective with his ten managerial roles grouped into Interpersonal, Informational, and Decisional categories. Unlike Fayol’s static and process-oriented approach, Mintzberg’s framework focused on real-world managerial interactions and decision-making, capturing the complexities of daily managerial tasks.


Synthesis
Fayol provides the structure, while Mintzberg highlights the dynamics of management. Together, they offer complementary insights into effective management practices.


Conclusion and Key Takeaways
Mastering management functions is essential for managers to align resources, foster collaboration, and drive organizational success. By blending theoretical insights from pioneers like Fayol with practical frameworks like Mintzberg’s roles, managers can enhance decision-making and adaptability. This balance leads to better team performance, higher productivity, and long-term growth.",1. Resistance due to morphological characters :,,,,

They lack material form and hence services cannot be demonstrated as like goods. Service providers must deliver qualify services on time to the consumers to win their confidence.
Inseparability: One of the important features of service is that the service and the service: provider cannot be separated from each other. The presence of service provider is necessary at the time of providing the service. The production and consumption of service take place simultaneously.
Inconsistency: Services are inconsistent and heterogeneous. Services lack perfect standardisation. The quality of service may differ person to person and from time to time although service provider remain the same.
Perishability: Services are perishable in nature. The production and consumption of services cannot be separated and hence services cannot be stored for future consumption.
Non-Transferability: The ownership of services cannot be transferred from service provider to the user. All consumer services are non-transferable in nature.
Consumer participation: The service provider cannot offer or render services without the presence of consumer. Similarly customer cannot get services in the absence of service provider. Hence, participation of consumer and presence of service provider is equally important.

Various consumer related programmes are also telecast on various TV channels and social media and broadcasted on All India Radio and FM channels.

5) Consumer Organisations: Many consumer organisations such as Consumer Guidance Society of India, Grahak Panchayat, Grahak Shakti, Consumers’ Association, etc., are active throughout India to fight for consumers’ rights through protest, campaigning, lobbying, etc. It is now required to strengthen consumer movement throughout the country.

6) Consumer Welfare Fund (CWF): This fund is created by the Department of Consumer Affairs for providing financial help to voluntary consumer movement specially in rural areas. This financial assistance is used for consumer education, complaint handling, counselling, guidance, etc.

7) Legislative measures: The Government of India has passed several Acts such as Sales of Goods, Act, 1930; Essential Commodities Act, 1955; Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1956; Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1969; Food Safety and Standard Act, 2006 and National Food Security Act, 2013, etc. to protect the interest of consumers.

However, these laws could not protect the consumers as such and therefore the Government of India has passed a powerful act known as Consumer Protection Act, 2019 to protect the interest of consumers.

Consumer Protection Act, 2019-

The Consumer Protection Act was passed by the Parliament on 24th December, 1986 to provide for expeditious and inexpensive settlement of consumer disputes. In 2019, the Ministry of Law and Justice has proposed new act as ‘Consumer Protection Act, 2019’ which got the President’s assent on 9th August 2019. This Act, provided for the establishment of three-tier quasi-judicial consumer dispute redressed agencies known as District Commission, State Commission and National Commission at District Level, State Level and National Level respectively. National Commission also acts as an Apex body at the central level. This act provides and covers all the complaints in respect to goods, services and unfair business practices.

1) District Commission: A consumer dispute redressal commission called the District Commi¬ssion is established by the State Government in each district to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed ₹ 1 crore. Each district commission shall consist of the President who is sitting or retired as a district Judge and who is not less than 35 years. The members will hold office for a term of 5 years or up to the age of 65 years whichever is earlier. Territorial jurisdiction of district commission is entire district in which it is established. Any person not satisfied with the order of District Commission can appeal against such order to the State Commission within a period of 45 days from the date of such order.

2) State Commission: A Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission called the State Commission is established by the State Government in each state to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, exceeds ₹ 1 crore but does not exceed ₹10 crore. Each State Commission shall consist of President who is sitting or retired Judge of High Court and not less than 4 members. The members will hold office for a term of 5 years or up to the age of 67 years whichever is earlier. It can entertain original cases as well as appeals against the order of District Commission which are within the territorial jurisdiction of the entire state in which it is established. Any person not satisfied with the order of State Commission can appeal against such order to the National Commission within a period of 30 days from the date of such order.

3) National Commission: A Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at the national level established by the Central Government by notification is referred to as National Commission. It entertains complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration exceeds ₹ 10 crore. National Commission consists of President who is sitting or retired as judge of the Supreme Court and not less than 4 members. The members will hold office for a term of 5 years or up to the age prescribed whichever is earlier. It entertains original cases and appeals against the order of State Commission which are within the territorial jurisdiction of the entire nation. Any person not satisfied with the order passed by the National Commission may appeal against such order to the Supreme Court within a period of 30 days from the date of such order.

Role of Consumer Organisations and NGOs-

Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) are non-profit and non-political organisation which aim at promoting the welfare of the people.
The Role of consumer organisation and NGOs in Consumer Protection and Education:

To arrange and organise campaigns and different programmes on the topics of consumers to create social awareness.
To arrange training programmes for consumers to make them aware of their rights and different modes of redressal of their complaints and grievances.
To publish journals, periodicals to make consumers understand about various consumer related development.
To provide free legal advice to the members on the issues of consumer’s interest and help them to put up grievances before appropriate authority.
To communicate with the businessmen, Chambers of Commerce and Industry for ensuring a better deal for consumers.
To file Janahit Yachika (Public interest litigation) on vital consumers issues like ban on sale of products injurious to public health.
The following are the examples of NGOs: Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI), Voluntary Organisation in Interest of Consumer Education (VOICE), Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC), Consumers Association of India (CAI), Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP), Grahak Shakti (GS).",,,,,

Introduction-

The important objective of all business organisations is to fulfil the needs and wants of the society. This is possible only through marketing of goods and services. Marketing is therefore considered as centre point of all business activities. Production of goods and services become meaningless if business organisations are not able to market their goods and services effectively. Thus, nowadays marketing is indispensable feature of the business. Marketing now becomes part and parcel of modern days of life. Individual as well as social needs are satisfied only through marketing.

Marketing helps to improve standard of living and to gain loyal customers by providing wide variety of goods and services. It also helps to generate and increase employment opportunities. Marketing is pervasive in nature and it influences our daily life. Marketing is a science and an art competitive, growing and cut throat competition inspires organisations to know marketing as a discipline of management.

Meaning and Definition of Marketing-

Marketing is considered as a main function of modern management. Marketing is a social process: through which need (desire) is created, offered and exchange via products and services. Marketing is a wider concept which includes selling and other functions. Marketing and selling though interchangeably used and seem to be similar concept, ‘Marketing’ involves a process of satisfying consumer needs. It includes all those activities which effect transfer of ownership and possession of goods and services for physical distribution, Satisfaction of consumer is the centre point of marketing concept. It is consumer oriented. In brief, marketing is the activity, set of institutions and processes for creating, communicating, handing over and exchanging offerings that have value for the consumers, clients, partners and society at large, it is an indirect activity and integrated process of identification, assessment and satisfaction of human wants.

American Marketing Association, defines Marketing as “the activity, set of institutions, and processesfor creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.”

Concept of Market-

The word ‘Market’ has originated from the Latin word ‘mercatus’. It means ‘to trade’, to trade merchandise’ or ‘a place where business is being carried out’. In brief, market is a place where two or more parties called buyer, seller and intermediary are involved in the buying and selling of goods and services, with the exchange of money called price. In the modern days, buyers and sellers can conduct trade by telephone, internet, mail, social media platforms, etc.

Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing

The different concepts associated with the term market are explained briefly as follows:

1) Place concept of market: In the place concept of market emphasis is given on the place where transaction of trading (i.e buying and selling) of goods and services is done in the exchange of money or money’s worth. In ancient days, place played a significant role in defining the term market. But due to development of information technology the meaning of the term market has widened to great extent.

2) Commodity concept of market: In this concept of market, buying and selling of goods and services are given more importance. In this process, commodity/parties to the transaction, viz. buyer and seller play an important role.

3) Exchange concept of market: This concept of market gives more stress on the exchange of goods or services between buyer and seller. It further states that there should be free or voluntary consent and mutual trust. During the exchange neither any fraud nor misrepresentation should be committed by either party. Similarly coercion or undue influence should not be applied during the exchange.

4) Area concept of market: This concept ot market gives stress on free association between buyer and seller to determine (fix) the price of goods for its trading. According to this concept, buyer and seller can fix the price by taking help of modern communication means and exchange goods or service without meeting each other personally.

5) Demand or Customer concept of market: This concept of market states that customer is the king of the market and market should be studied from the angle of demand or customer. It is further stated that the aggregate (total) demand of potential buyers for the products is considered as market.

6) Space or Digital concept of market: On account of advent of information technology, new concept of market, i.e. space or digital concept comes into existence. Now sophisticated e-commerce portals and mobile applications, internet, computer, etc. have made trading of goods and services easy and convenient for buyers and sellers.

The use of information technology has made it easier for customers to make direct contact with sellers, know about the features, v price, quality, terms and conditions, etc. of any product or service across the globe. Accordingly, the market that uses information technology for trading of the products or services is called digital market. It facilitates communication of quality, features, price and terms of exchange among them.

Types of Market-

The chart showing different types of market is as follow:

Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing 2

The different types of markets are explained as follows:

1) On the basis of Area Covered:

Local Market: Market which is established in the local geographical area of a region within which goods and services are bought and sold is called local market, e.g. purchase of goods from nearest shop.
National Market: Market which is established within a country with which goods and services are bought and sold is called national market, e.g. purchase of clothes from Ahmedabad by a customer residing in Kochi.
International Market: The market where the goods and services produced in one country are sold in many other countries is called international market, e.g. import of advanced technology from U.S.A. by India.
Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing

2) On the basis of time:

Very Short Period Market: The market which has its existence for very short period of time is called very short period market. This market has existence for few hours, e.g. market for perishable goods such as fish, vegetables, fruits, etc.
Short Period Market: The market which is organised and continued for short period is called short period market, e.g. a weekly market, market during festival, fairs, etc. They deal in semi- durable and perishable goods.
Long Period Market: The market which is organised and continued for long period of time is called long period market, e.g. market for durable commodities.
3) On the basis of Volume of Transaction:

Wholesale Market: The market in which goods and services are bought and sold in large quantities at cheaper rates is called wholesale market. In this market, goods are sold to retailers in moderate quantities who then sell them to ultimate consumers in very small quantities, e.g. wholesale market for yarn.
Retail Market: The market in which goods are directly sold by retailers to ultimate consumers in very small quantity is called retail market, e.g. grocery shop located in residential area.
4) On the basis of Importance:

Primary market: The market where primary products are bought and sold is called primary market, e.g. grain market, fruit market, etc.
Secondary market: The market where semi-processed and semi-manufactured goods are traded is called secondary market, e.g. iron-ore market.
Terminal market: The market where finished goods are traded to ultimate consumers is called terminal market, e.g. industrial goods market.
5) On the basis of Nature of Goods:

Commodity Market: The market where goods, materials or produce, viz. consumer goods and industrial goods are sold is called commodity market, e.g. consumer goods market.
Capital Market: The market where long term funds are borrowed and given is called capital market, e.g. new issue market.
6) On the basis of Regulation:

Regulated Market: The market which is governed, regulated and controlled by the statutory or legal provisions of the country is called regulated market, e.g. Stock Exchanges, Foreign Exchanges, etc.
Unregulated or Free Market: The market which is not regulated or controlled by any specific act of parliament but is operated as per forces of demand and supply is called unregulated or free market, e.g. market for different products or services.
(7) On the basis of Competition:

Perfect Market: The market where large number of buyers and large number of sellers buy and sell homogeneous product at a prevailing single price is called perfect market. Neither single buyer nor single seller can influence the price. They have perfect knowledge of market condition.
Imperfect competition : A market which has certain features of imperfection such as single seller, imperfect knowledge of market conditions on the part of buyers and sellers, failure to make adjustment in demand and supply, etc. is called imperfect market, e.g. monopoly market.
Imperfect market is further classified as:

Monopoly : A market structure which is characterised by a single seller selling unique product which has no close substitute is called monopoly market. Monopoly controls the entire supply in the market. He the price maker.
Duopoly : A market situation in which two sellers who either sell a homogeneous product or differentiated product is called duopoly market. Sellers enjoy a monopoly in the product produced and sold by them.
Oligopoly : A market situation in which there are limited (few) number of sellers or producers selling either a homogeneous product or differentiated product is called oligopoly.
Monopsony : A market situation in which there is only one buyer and purchaser of goods and services offered by many producers or sellers is called monopsony, e.g. labour market, a firm is the sole buyer of certain kind of labour.
Importance of marketing-

The importance of marketing is shown in the following diagram:
Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing 3

Importance of marketing is explained as follows:

(A) Importance of Marketing to the Society:

1) Increase in standard of living: Marketing helps to find out the needs of consumers and accordingly make efforts to supply quality products at cheaper rates to fulfil their needs. This in turn raises and maintains standard of living of the consumers. In recent years, the large scale production of goods and services has considerably reduced the prices which helps to enhance standard of living of the poor and middle class people.

Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing

2) Provides employment: Modern marketing undertakes almost all functions of organisations ; such as buying, selling, financing, transport, warehousing, risk bearing, research and development, etc. which require more human power. This generates more job opportunities in different capacities and helps to solve the problem of unemployment.

3) Decreases distribution costs: Effective and proper utilisation of channel of distribution reduces overall cost of production of products and services. Thus, marketing makes goods and services available at cheaper prices.

4) Consumer awareness: Marketing helps the society by educating the consumers providing them information of availability of goods and services in the market. Marketing also helps in making right purchases.

5) Increases in National Income: Well organised and effective marketing of products and i services facilitates industrialisation, increase job opportunities and develops the economy rapidly. This makes the economy more stronger and stable I which in turn increases national income.

6) Managing consumer expectations: Marketing research enables the business organisations to understand the requirements of the consumers which arc useful in development of products. By studying and considering customers’ review, business organisations make major changes in the products. Government regulations stop marketers to make false and misleading claims.

(B) Importance of Marketing to the Firm:

1) Increases awareness: Marketing provides detailed information and creates awareness among the consumers about the existing products, new arrivals and the company selling specific products in the market.

2) Increases sales: After providing information about the products or services among the customers, marketing attracts them to buy the products or services. Successful marketing campaign enables the business organisations to enhance the sales of the organisation. Expansion in sales increases profit which can be reinvested in the business to earn more profits in the future.

3) Creates trust: The consumers usually prefer to buy goods and services from those business organisations which have trustworthy reputation in the market. Trustworthiness creates customer loyalty and earns loyal customers.

4) Basis for making decisions ; The business organisations are required to take several decisions before delivering the products to the ultimate consumers. The business organisations are required to have several decisions before delivering the products to ultimate consumers. They are required to face many problems in relation to production of goods and services. When business expands, decision making process becomes more complex. Effective marketing facilitates organi¬sations to take right decisions at the right time.

5) Source of new ideas: Marketing facilitates business organisations to know the needs of the consumers. Feedbacks received from the consumers are useful to make improvement in the existing products. Due to marketing, organisations, understand the changing tastes and preferences of the consumers. By considering these changes and new demand pattern, research and development department develops new products in which 4 Ps of marketing mix play major role.

6) Tackling the competition: Due to increasing competition it is now difficult to create monopoly. Marketing creates brand loyalty in the minds of potential buyers. Marketing conveys salient features, advantages, uses, etc. of the goods ! and services to the consumers and induces them to buy the same. The business organisations can make use of modern technology for effective marketing.

(C) Importance of Marketing to the Consumers:

1) Promotes product awareness: The business enterprises undertake marketing activities to promote various marketing activities ; to promote their products. Marketing creates awareness among the customers about different products and brands available in the market. It facilitates consumers to take right decisions on the purchases. The consumers can compare product features, their availability, price, etc. and select right products. Marketing also improves the: quality of life of the consumers.

2) Provides quality products: Due to increasing competition in the market, consumers get information about the products and services available in the market. Marketing also creates moral pressure on the organisations to sell quality products and services to the consumers. If business organisations supply defective products, it will create negative image of the organisations which in turn affects customers’ loyalty adversely.

3) Provides variety of products: Marketing: provides information about the products to the consumers and thereby induces them to purchase them. The business organisations are required to ! launch product by considering market segments. They are required to make available variety of goods to fulfil the requirements of different market segments of the consumers.

4) Helps in selection: In the competitive markets, different variety of products with different brands are available. Marketing enables the consumers to select the best products and services from different options available.

Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing

5) Customer satisfaction: The main aim of marketing policy is to give assurance of good quality products to the consumers. When the needs of the consumers are fulfilled, the consumers get satisfied. Marketing efforts result into customers’ satisfaction by way of honest advertising, assurance of quality products and accessibility of innovative products. In this way marketing makes efforts to give satisfaction to the consumers.

6) Regular supply of goods: Regular supply of goods to the consumers is practicable through effective and efficient distribution channel of marketing. Marketing also helps to stabilise the prices of products in the market.

Functions of Marketing-

1) Marketing research: The marketing research assists the organisations to assess the need in the market, identify the requirement of consumers, time of purchases, quantity of their purchases and prices at which products and services are traded, etc. Marketing helps the business organisations to take decisions on the marketing of products and services.

2) Buying and assembling: This function is related to purchase of raw materials from various places and to bring them at one place for further processing and production. This function is more important because quality and price of raw materials fix the cost and quality of final products.

3) Market planning: This function is concerned with preparing outline of market plan and strategies to accomplish the objectives of the organisation. Market planning means defining, determining and organising the marketing aims and objectives of the business and preparing strategies to achieve those aims and objectives.

4) Product development: Every business organisation is required to develop its products to suit the needs of the consumers. Most of the customers prefer to buy better and attractively designed products. Good and attractive design of the products also increase its turnover and profit. Product development is ongoing (continuous) process due to changing needs and preferences of the customers.

5) Standardisation and grading: Standisation means setting up certain norms in relation to design, quality, size, process, weight, colour, etc. of the products. It ensures uniformity of products and helps to gain customers’ loyalty towards products. Grading means physical sorting and classifying the products according to standard set up. Usually, grading is done in case of agricultural commodities.

6) Packaging and labelling: Designing the package for the products in an attractive manner is called packaging. It protects the products from breakage, leakage, damage and destruction. A slip providing information of product and its producer pasted or affixed on the product container is called ] label and its processing is called labelling, Packaging and labelling give protection to the product and serve an effective tool of marketing.

7) Branding: Giving a distinct name to product to identify it, is called branding. A brand which is registered is called Trademark. It gives separate identity and recognition among the consumers which helps to expand business and increase brand awareness.

8) Customers support service: The business organisations, must take every possible step to ; render support services to the customers. It increases customers’ loyalty towards the business, The customers support services include pre-sales services, after sales services, customer helpline, i technical assistance, product demonstration, etc.
It facilitates organisation to get, increase and retain the customers.

9) Pricing of products: Fixing the prices of the products is an important and challenging function of marketing. While determining the price the business organisation is required to consider several factors such as cost, desired profit, price of the competitors’ product, etc. The price fixed should neither be too high which may lose customers nor too low which compel the organisation to incur loss.

10) Promotional channels: The process of convening the consumers’ information of the products, their features, prices, uses, etc. and inducing them to buy the products is called promotion. Personal selling advertisement, publicity and sales promotion are the important tools of promotion. Promotional activities increase brand awareness in the market.

11) Distribution: The activities which are related to movement of finished products from the place of business to the doorsteps of consumers are called distribution. It comprises of transportation, order processing, material handling, warehousing, inventory control, market forecasting, etc. The importance of distribution mostly depends on the type of product and level of customer satisfaction.

12) Transportation: The physical movement of products, raw materials, etc. from place of origin to the place of production or to the place of consumers is called transportation. It creates place utility. The modes of transport include road, air, water, railways, pipeline transport, etc.

13) Warehousing: Warehousing refers to storing of goods, in a godown to hold them in stock from the time of production or purchase till the time of their sale. Warehousing maintains balance between supply and demand of products and helps to stabilise the prices in the market. Warehousing creates time utility.

Marketing Mix-

Marketing mix refers to the mixture or combination of various marketing variables that business enterprises intermix and control to get expected results from the target market. In other words, it means placing the right product at right price, at right place and at right time. Every business organisation must develop appropriate marketing mix to expand turnover and achieve its objective.

The 4 Ps of marketing mix viz. Product, Price, Place and Promotion were introduced by E. Jerome McCarthy in 1960. Then in 1981, it was further extended by Booms & Bitner by adding of 3 new elements, viz. People, Process and Physical Environment. The first 4 Ps are called product marketing mix and last 3 Ps are called services marketing mix. 7 Ps of marketing mix are shown in the following diagram.

Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing 4

1) Product: An article, goods, commodity, or service that is offered to the customers for sale is called ‘product’. It has capacity to satisfy the needs of customers. The product may be either tangible or intangible. It may be in the form of goods or services. Through market research the business organisations decide the right type of products to be produced and sold. Products sold create impact on the mind of customers on which success or failure of business depends.

2) Price: The amount of money given or required to buy a product is called ‘price’. The factors such as cost of product, willingness of the customers to pay for the product, value, utility, etc. are required to be considered while determing the price of a product. Price of the product should not be too high which affects the demand adversely. Similarly it should not be too low which reduces the profitability.

3) Place: Place is the element of marketing mix that ensures that right product is distributed and made available to the potential buyers at right location and at right time too. The organisations need to distribute the products at a place easily approachable to the potential consumers.

Maharashtra Board OCM 12th Commerce Notes Chapter 8 Marketing

4) Promotion: Promotion refers to any type of marketing communication used to inform and
persuade potential buyers or consumers to buy the products. Promotion mix comprises of different tools such as advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, personal selling, etc. Promotional strategies to be used depend on the budget, target market and the message to be communicated.

5) People: The people inside and outside the business create impact or influence on the business. People include all individuals, that play key role in offering the products or services to the customers. Right people appointed to work at right place add value to the business. Organisations must recruit right people, train them and retain them for their success.

6) Process: The steps taken by the business organization to carry the products from the place of business to the place of consumers are called process. Process are significant to provide quality service. Good process saves time and cost and ensures same standard of service by enhancing efficiency.

7) Physical Environment: The marketing environment in which the interactions between the customers and firm takes place is called the physical environment. While offering services, the service providers always try to incorporate certain tangible elements into their offering to increase customer experience. In the service market, physical evidence is necessary to ensure that service is provided successfully. The physical evidence creates an impact on the customers’ satisfaction. Physical evidence comprises location, layout, packaging, branding, interior design, the dress of the employees, their action, waiting area, etc.",2. Resistance due to biochemical characters :,,,,
,,Physics,Rotational Dynamics,"What is Rotational Motion?
“Rotational motion can be defined as the motion of an object around a circular path, in a fixed orbit.”

The dynamics for rotational motion are completely analogous to linear or translational dynamics. Many of the equations for mechanics of rotating objects are similar to the motion equations for linear motion. In rotational motion, only rigid bodies are considered. A rigid body is an object with a mass that holds a rigid shape.

Rotational Motion About a Fixed Axis
The figure below shows a rotating body that has a point with zero velocity about which the object undergoes rotational motion. This point can be on the body or at any point away from it. Since the axis of rotation is fixed, we consider only those components of the torques applied to the object that is along this axis, as only these components cause rotation in the body. The perpendicular component of the torque will tend to turn the axis of rotation for the object from its position.

Dynamics of Rotational Motion

This results in the emergence of some necessary forces of constraint, which finally tends to cancel the effect of these perpendicular components, thus restricting the movement of the axis from its fixed position, rendering its position to be maintained. Since the perpendicular components cause no effect, these components are not considered during the calculation. For any rigid body undergoing a rotational motion about a fixed axis, we need to consider only the forces that lie in planes perpendicular to the axis.

Why are parallel position vectors not considered?
Forces that are parallel to the axis will give torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account. Also, only the components of the position vector that are perpendicular to the axis are considered. Components of position vectors along the axis result in torques perpendicular to the axis and thus are not to be taken into account.

Rotational Motion Examples
Examples of Rotation about a fixed point
Ceiling fan rotation, rotation of the minute hand and the hour hand in the clock, and the opening and closing of the door are some of the examples of rotation about a fixed point.

Examples of Rotation about an axis of rotation
Rotation about an axis of rotation includes translational as well as rotational motion. The best example of rotation about an axis of rotation is pushing a ball from an inclined plane. The ball reaches the bottom of the inclined plane through translational motion while the motion of the ball is happening as it is rotating about its axis, which is rotational motion.

Another example of rotation about an axis of rotation is the earth’s motion. The earth rotates about its axis every day, and it also rotates around the sun once every year. This is a classic example of translational motion as well as rotational motion.

Watch the video and learn how gymnasts increase and decrease their speed while rotating.

The moment of inertia measures the object’s resistance to the change in its rotation. The moment inertia is symbolized as I and is measured in kilogram metre² (kg m2.) The moment of inertia is given by the following equations:

I = Mr2, where m is the particle’s mass, and r is the distance from the axis of rotation.

The moment of inertia depends on the particle’s mass; the larger the mass, the greater the moment of inertia.

Following is the table for a moment of inertia for symmetric bodies:

Symmetric body	Moment of inertia
Ring with a symmetric axis	
 
Cylinder or disc with a symmetric axis	
 
 
Uniform sphere	
 
 
Rod with the axis through the end	
 
 
Rod with the axis at the centre	
 
 
Torque
Torque is the twisting effect of the force applied to a rotating object which is at a position r from its axis of rotation. Mathematically, this relationship is represented as follows:

 
Angular Momentum
The angular momentum L measures the difficulty of bringing a rotating object to rest. It is given by the following equation:

 
Comparison of Translational Motion and Rotational Motion
The table below lists the quantities associated with linear motion and its analogous in rotational motion:
 
Rotational Motion and Work-Energy Principle
According to the work-energy principle, the total work done by the sum of all the forces acting on an object is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the object.

In rotational motion, the concept of the work-energy principle is based on torque. It is stated as the object is said to be in a balanced state if its displacements and rotations are equal to zero when a force is applied.

Consider a rigid body such that Δ𝛳 is the small rotation experienced by the object. Then the linear displacement is given as Δr = rΔ𝛳. This is perpendicular to the r.

Therefore, the work done is

ΔW = F perpendicular to Δr

ΔW = F Δr sin 𝜙 

ΔW = Fr Δ𝛳 sin 𝜙 

ΔW = 𝜏Δ𝛳

When the number of forces acting is increased, then the work done is given as

ΔW = (𝜏1 + 𝜏2 + ……) Δ𝛳

But we know that Δ𝛳 is the same for all forces.

Therefore, the work done will be zero, that is

𝜏1 + 𝜏2 + …… = 0

Hence, the work-energy principle for rotational motion is proved.

Relationship Between Torque, Moment of Inertia, and Angular Acceleration
The rotational dynamics can be understood if you have ever pushed a merry-go-round. We observe that the change in the angular velocity of a merry-go-round is possible when a force is applied to it. Another example is the spinning of the bike wheel. As the force is increased, the angular acceleration produced in the wheel would be greater. Therefore, we can say that there is a relationship between the force, mass, angular velocity, and angular acceleration.

Consider a wheel of the bike. Let F be the force acting on the wheel, such as angular acceleration produced is 𝛼. Let r be the radius of the wheel. We know that the force is acting perpendicular to the radius. We also know that

F = ma

Where a is acceleration = r𝛼

Therefore,

F = mr𝛼

We have learned that torque is the turning effect of the force. Therefore,

𝜏 = Fr

rF = mr2𝛼

𝜏 = mr2𝛼

Therefore, we can say that the last equation is the rotational analog of F = ma such that torque is analog of force, angular acceleration is analog of acceleration, and rotational inertia that is mr2 is analog of mass. Rotational inertia is also known as moment of inertia.

The relationship between torque, the moment of inertia, and angular acceleration is

net 𝜏 = I𝛼

𝛼 = net 𝜏/I

Where net 𝜏 is the total torqu",The high aspartic acid and low nitrogen and sugar content in maize : Resistance against stem borers.,,,,
,,,Mechanical Properties of Fluids,"What is Fluid?
Fluid is the name given to a substance which begins to flow when external force is applied to it.

Fluids possess characteristic physical properties that govern how they behave when forces are applied to them.

What are the mechanical properties of fluids?
The science of the mechanical properties of fluids is called Hydrostatics. A fluid is a substance which yields to the slightest pressure.

Fluids are divided into two classes distinguished by the names of liquids, and elastic fluids or gases, which later comprehend the air of the atmosphere and all the various kinds of air with which chemistry makes us acquainted. We shall confine our attention at present to the mechanical properties of liquids or non-elastic fluids.

Fluids show the effects of gravitation in a more perfect manner than solid bodies; the strong cohesive attraction of the particles of the latter in some measure counteracting the effect of gravity.

Streamline Flow
A streamline is a curve the tangent to which at any point gives the direction of the fluid velocity at that point. It is analogous to a line of force in an electric or a magnetic field. In steady flow the pattern of the streamline is stationary with time and therefore, a streamline gives the actual path of a fluid particle. A steady flow is therefore also called a streamlined flow or laminar flow. No two streamlines can ever cross one another, for if they did, a fluid particle arriving at that point could go one way or the other and the flow would not be steady.

Streamline Flow

Tube of Flow
A tubular region of fluid enclosed by a boundary consisting of streamlines is called a tube of flow. No fluid can cross the boundaries of a tube of flow and therefore, a tube of flow behaves like a pipe of the same shape.

Surface Tension and Viscosity
The amount of force per unit length necessary to deform this interfacial surface is called the surface tension, and is denoted by the Greek letter sigma.

The surface tension of a liquid is always a function of the solid or fluid with which the liquid is in contact. If a value for surface tension is given in a table for oil, water, mercury, or whatever, and the contacting fluid is not specified, it is safe to assume that the contacting fluid is air.

The viscosity of a fluid is defined as the ratio of the shearing stress between adjacent layers of fluid to the rate of change of velocity perpendicular to the direction of motion. More simply stated, viscosity is the property of a fluid which causes the fluid to resist flow. The higher the viscosity of a fluid the more it will resist flowing. The viscosity of most of the fluids we encounter in everyday life is independent of the applied external force.

Surface Tension and Viscosity

Bernoulli’s Principle and Equation
Bernoulli’s Principle states that the total energy of the water always remains constant, therefore, when the water flow in a system increases, the pressure must decrease. When water starts to flow in a hydraulic system the pressure drops. When the flow stops, the pressure rises again.

Bernoulli’s Principle and Equation

In a hydraulic system, the total energy head is equal to the sum of three individual energy heads. This can be expressed as:

Total head = [Elevation head + Pressure head + Velocity head]

Where the elevation head is the pressure due to the elevation of the water, the pressure head is the height of a column of water that a given hydrostatic pressure in a system could support and the velocity head is the energy present due to the velocity of the water.

Pressure and Its Applications
All liquids and gases are fluids. The force exerted normally at a unit area of the surface of a fluid is called fluid pressure.

Consider a liquid which is confined in a closed vessel. Let the temperature of the liquid is 20oC and the pressure is atmospheric. This liquid will evaporate at 100oC. When vaporization takes place, the molecules escape from the free surface of the liquid. These vapour molecules get accumulated in the space between the free liquid surface and the top of the vessel. These accumulated vapours exert pressure on the liquid surface. Pressure is known as vapour pressure of the liquid. Or this is the pressure at which the liquid is converted into vapours.",The nectar-less cotton having smooth leaves : Resistance against bollworms.,,,,
,,,Kinetic Theory of Gases and Radiataion,"The kinetic theory of gases explains the three macroscopic properties of a gas in terms of the microscopic nature of atoms and molecules making up the gas. Usually, the physical properties of solids and liquids can be described by their size, shape, mass, volume, etc. However, when we talk about gases, they have no definite shape or size, while mass and volume are not directly measurable. The kinetic theory of gases is useful and can be applied in this case.

With the help of the kinetic theory of gases, the physical properties of any gas can be generally defined in terms of three measurable macroscopic properties: the pressure, volume and temperature of the container where the gas is stored or present. We will learn about this concept in detail below.

What Is the Kinetic Theory of Gases?
The kinetic theory of gases is a theoretical model that describes the molecular composition of the gas in terms of a large number of submicroscopic particles, which include atoms and molecules. Further, the theory explains that gas pressure arises due to particles colliding with each other and the walls of the container. The kinetic theory of gases also defines properties such as temperature, volume and pressure, as well as transport properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity. It basically explains all the properties that are related to the microscopic phenomenon.

The significance of the theory is that it helps in developing a correlation between the macroscopic properties and the microscopic phenomenon. In simple terms, the kinetic theory of gases also helps us study the action of the molecules. Generally, the molecules of gases are always in motion, and they tend to collide with each other and the walls of the containers. In addition, the model also helps in understanding related phenomena, such as the Brownian motion.


Kinetic Theory of Gases Assumptions
The kinetic theory of gases considers the atoms or molecules of a gas as constantly moving point masses with huge inter-particle distances and may undergo perfectly elastic collisions. Implications of these assumptions are as follows:

i) Particles

Gas is a collection of a large number of atoms or molecules.

ii) Point Masses

Atoms or molecules making up the gas are very small particles like a point (dot) on a paper with a small mass.

iii) Negligible Volume Particles

Particles are generally far apart such that their inter-particle distance is much larger than the particle size, and there is large free unoccupied space in the container. Compared to the volume of the container, the volume of the particle is negligible (zero volume).

iv) Nil Force of Interaction

Particles are independent. They do not have any (attractive or repulsive) interactions among themselves.

v) Particles in Motion

The particles are always in constant motion. Because of the lack of interactions and the free space available, the particles randomly move in all directions but in a straight line.

vi) Volume of Gas

Because of motion, gas particles occupy the total volume of the container, whether it is small or big, and hence the volume of the container is to be treated as the volume of the gases.

vi) Mean Free Path

This is the average distance a particle travels to meet another particle.

vii) Kinetic Energy of the Particle

Since the particles are always in motion, they have average kinetic energy proportional to the temperature of the gas.

viii) Constancy of Energy/Momentum

Moving particles may collide with other particles or containers. But the collisions are perfectly elastic. Collisions do not change the energy or momentum of the particle.

ix) Pressure of Gas

The collision of the particles on the walls of the container exerts a force on the walls of the container. Force per unit area is the pressure. The pressure of the gas is thus proportional to the number of particles colliding (frequency of collisions) in unit time per unit area on the wall of the container.


Kinetic Theory of Gases Postulates
The kinetic theory of gas postulates is useful in understanding the macroscopic properties from the microscopic properties.

Gases consist of a large number of tiny particles (atoms and molecules). These particles are extremely small compared to the distance between the particles. The size of the individual particle is considered negligible, and most of the volume occupied by the gas is empty space.
These molecules are in constant random motion, which results in colliding with each other and with the walls of the container. As the gas molecules collide with the walls of a container, the molecules impart some momentum to the walls. Basically, this results in the production of a force that can be measured. So, if we divide this force by the area, it is defined to be the pressure.
The collisions between the molecules and the walls are perfectly elastic, which means when the molecules collide, they do not lose kinetic energy. Molecules never slow down and will stay at the same speed.
The average kinetic energy of the gas particles changes with temperature; i.e., the higher the temperature, the higher the average kinetic energy of the gas.
The molecules do not exert any force of attraction or repulsion on one another except during collisions.
A) Understanding Gas Laws of Ideal Gases
i) Pressure α Amount or Number of Particles at Constant Volume

The collision of the particles on the walls of the container creates pressure. Larger the number of the particle (amount) of the gas, the more the number of particles colliding with the walls of the container.

At constant temperature and volume, the larger the amount (or the number of particles) of the gas, the higher will be the pressure.

ii) Avogadro’s Law – N α V at Constant Pressure

When there is a greater number of particles, it increases the collisions and the pressure. If the pressure is to remain constant, the number of collisions can be reduced only by increasing the volume.

At constant pressure, the volume is proportional to the amount of gas.

ii) Boyle’s Law – Pressure

 
 
at Constant Temperature
At a constant temperature, the kinetic energy of particles remains the same. If the volume is reduced at a constant temperature, then the number of particles in unit volume or area increases. If there is an increased number of particles in the unit area, then it increases the frequency of collisions per unit area.

At constant temperature, the smaller the volume of the container, the larger the pressure.

ii) Amonton’s Law: P α T at Constant Volume

The kinetic energy of the particle increases with temperature. When the volume is constant, with increased energy, particles move fast and increase the frequency of collisions per unit time on the walls of the container and hence the pressure.

At constant volume, the higher the temperature, the higher will be the pressure of the gas.

iv) Charles’s Law – V α T at Constant Pressure

The change of temperature changes proportionately to the pressure. If the pressure also has to remain constant, then the number of collisions has to be changed proportionately. At constant pressure and a constant amount of substance, collisions can be changed only by changing the area or volume.

At constant pressure, volume changes proportionally to temperature.B) Understanding Non-ideal Gas Behaviour
All the gas molecules obey the ideal gas laws only under special conditions of low pressures and high temperatures. The deviations of the real gases from the ideal gas behaviour are traced mainly to making wrong or incorrect assumptions in the postulates, and they are given below:

The particles are point charges and have no volume: Then, it should be possible to compress the gases to zero volume. But, gases cannot be compressed to zero volume, which indicates that particles do have volume though small and cannot be neglected.
Particles are independent and do not interact:  Particles do interact depending upon their nature. The interactions affect the pressure of the gas. Volume and interactions differ from gas to gas. Many gas laws have been developed for real gases incorporating correction factors in the pressure and volume of the gases.
Particle collisions are not elastic: Particle collisions are elastic, and they exchange energy. The particles hence do not have the same energy and have a distribution of energy.

C) Maxwell – Boltzmann Molecular Distribution of Energy and Velocity
The kinetic theory of gas postulates predicted the particles as always in motion and that they have kinetic energy proportional to the temperature of the gas.

This concept was used by Maxwell – Boltzmann to find the distribution of gaseous particles between energy zero to infinity and calculate the most probable, average and root mean square velocity of the particles.",,,,,
,,,Thermodynamics,"Thermodynamics deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms of energy. The four laws of thermodynamics govern the behaviour of these quantities and provide a quantitative description. William Thomson, in 1749, coined the term thermodynamics.

What is Thermodynamics?
Thermodynamics in physics is a branch that deals with heat, work and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation and physical properties of matter.

To be specific, it explains how thermal energy is converted to or from other forms of energy and how matter is affected by this process. Thermal energy is the energy that comes from heat. This heat is generated by the movement of tiny particles within an object, and the faster these particles move, the more heat is generated.
Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out. It is based on the initial and final states undergoing the change. It should also be noted that Thermodynamics is a macroscopic science. This means that it deals with the bulk system and does not deal with the molecular constitution of matter.

Distinction Between Mechanics and Thermodynamics
The distinction between mechanics and thermodynamics is worth noting. In mechanics, we solely concentrate on the motion of particles or bodies under the action of forces and torques. On the other hand, thermodynamics is not concerned with the motion of the system as a whole. It is only concerned with the internal macroscopic state of the body.

Different Branches of Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is classified into the following four branches:

Classical Thermodynamics
Statistical Thermodynamics
Chemical Thermodynamics
Equilibrium Thermodynamics
 

Classical Thermodynamics
In classical thermodynamics, the behaviour of matter is analysed with a macroscopic approach. Units such as temperature and pressure are taken into consideration, which helps the individuals calculate other properties and predict the characteristics of the matter undergoing the process.

Statistical Thermodynamics
In statistical thermodynamics, every molecule is under the spotlight, i.e. the properties of every molecule and how they interact are taken into consideration to characterise the behaviour of a group of molecules.

Chemical Thermodynamics
Chemical thermodynamics is the study of how work and heat relate to each other in chemical reactions and in changes of states.

Equilibrium Thermodynamics
Equilibrium thermodynamics is the study of transformations of energy and matter as they approach the state of equilibrium.

Basic Concepts of Thermodynamics – Thermodynamic Terms
Thermodynamics has its own unique vocabulary associated with it. A good understanding of the basic concepts forms a sound understanding of various topics discussed in thermodynamics preventing possible misunderstandings.

Thermodynamic Systems
Thermodynamic System

System
A thermodynamic system is a specific portion of matter with a definite boundary on which our attention is focused. The system boundary may be real or imaginary, fixed or deformable.
There are three types of systems:

Isolated System – An isolated system cannot exchange energy and mass with its surroundings. The universe is considered an isolated system.
Closed System – Across the boundary of the closed system, the transfer of energy takes place but the transfer of mass doesn’t take place. Refrigerator, compression of gas in the piston-cylinder assembly are examples of closed systems.
Open System – In an open system, the mass and energy both may be transferred between the system and surroundings. A steam turbine is an example of an open system.

Everything outside the system that has a direct influence on the behaviour of the system is known as a surrounding.

Thermodynamic Process
A system undergoes a thermodynamic process when there is some energetic change within the system that is associated with changes in pressure, volume and internal energy.

There are four types of thermodynamic processes that have their unique properties, and they are:

Adiabatic Process – A process where no heat transfer into or out of the system occurs.
Isochoric Process – A process where no change in volume occurs and the system does no work.
Isobaric Process – A process in which no change in pressure occurs.
Isothermal Process – A process in which no change in temperature occurs.

A thermodynamic cycle is a process or a combination of processes conducted such that the initial and final states of the system are the same. A thermodynamic cycle is also known as cyclic operation or cyclic processes.

Thermodynamic Equilibrium
At a given state, all properties of a system have fixed values. Thus, if the value of even one property changes, the system’s state changes to a different one. In a system that is in equilibrium, no changes in the value of properties occur when it is isolated from its surroundings.

When the temperature is the same throughout the entire system, we consider the system to be in thermal equilibrium.
When there is no change in pressure at any point of the system, we consider the system to be in mechanical equilibrium.
When the chemical composition of a system does not vary with time, we consider the system to be in chemical equilibrium.
Phase equilibrium in a two-phase system is when the mass of each phase reaches an equilibrium level.
A thermodynamic system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium if it is in chemical equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium and thermal equilibrium and the relevant parameters cease to vary with time.

Thermodynamic Properties
Thermodynamic properties are defined as characteristic features of a system, capable of specifying the system’s state. Thermodynamic properties may be extensive or intensive.

Intensive properties are properties that do not depend on the quantity of matter. Pressure and temperature are intensive properties.
In the case of extensive properties, their values depends on the mass of the system. Volume, energy, and enthalpy are extensive properties.
What is Enthalpy?
Enthalpy is the measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system. The quantity of enthalpy equals the total heat content of a system, equivalent to the system’s internal energy plus the product of volume and pressure.

Mathematically, the enthalpy, H, equals the sum of the internal energy, E, and the product of the pressure, P, and volume, V, of the system.

H = E + PV

What is Entropy?
Entropy is a thermodynamic quantity whose value depends on the physical state or condition of a system. In other words, it is a thermodynamic function used to measure the randomness or disorder.

For example, the entropy of a solid, where the particles are not free to move, is less than the entropy of a gas, where the particles will fill the container.

Thermodynamic Potentials
Thermodynamic potentials are quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials measure the energy changes in a system as they evolve from the initial state to the final state. Different potentials are used based on the system constraints, such as temperature and pressure.

Different forms of thermodynamic potentials along with their formula are tabulated below:

Internal Energy	
 
Helmholtz free energy	F = U – TS
Enthalpy	H = U + PV
Gibbs Free Energy	G = U + PV – TS

Laws of Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics laws define the fundamental physical quantities like energy, temperature and entropy that characterize thermodynamic systems at thermal equilibrium. These thermodynamics laws represent how these quantities behave under various circumstances.

How many laws of thermodynamics are there?
There are four laws of thermodynamics and are given below:

Zeroth law of thermodynamics
First law of thermodynamics
Second law of thermodynamics
Third law of thermodynamics
In the next few sections, we will discuss each of the laws of thermodynamics in detail.

Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
The Zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two bodies are individually in equilibrium with a separate third body, then the first two bodies are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

This means that if system A is in thermal equilibrium with system C and system B is also in equilibrium with system C, then system A and B are also in thermal equilibrium.

An example demonstrating the Zeroth Law
Two cups measuring 100 °C are in equilibrium with each other

Consider two cups A and B, with boiling water. When a thermometer is placed in cup A, it gets warmed up by the water until it reads 100 °C. When it reads 100 °C, we say that the thermometer is in equilibrium with cup A. When we move the thermometer to cup B to read the temperature, it continues to read 100 °C. The thermometer is also in equilibrium with cup B. By keeping in mind the zeroth law of thermodynamics, we can conclude that cup A and cup B are in equilibrium with each other.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics enables us to use thermometers to compare the temperature of any two objects that we like.

First Law of Thermodynamics
First law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of conservation of energy, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be changed from one form to another.

The first law of thermodynamics may seem abstract, but we will get a clearer idea if we look at a few examples of the first law of thermodynamics.

First Law Of Thermodynamics Examples:
Plants convert the radiant energy of sunlight to chemical energy through photosynthesis. We eat plants and convert the chemical energy into kinetic energy while we swim, walk, breathe, and scroll through this page.
Switching on light may seem to produce energy, but it is electrical energy that is converted.
Read More: First Law of Thermodynamics

Second Law of Thermodynamics
Second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy in an isolated system always increases. Any isolated system spontaneously evolves towards thermal equilibrium—the state of maximum entropy of the system.

The entropy of the universe only increases and never decreases. Many individuals take this statement lightly and for granted, but it has an extensive impact and consequence.

Visualizing the second law of thermodynamics
If a room is not tidied or cleaned, it invariably becomes more messy and disorderly with time. When the room is cleaned, its entropy decreases, but the effort to clean it has resulted in increased entropy outside the room exceeding the entropy lost.

Read More: Second Law of Thermodynamics

The video below dives deep into the second law of thermodynamics and will help one take a closer look at how entropy explains disorderliness.
 


1,28,260
Third Law of Thermodynamics
Third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.

The entropy of a pure crystalline substance (perfect order) at absolute zero temperature is zero. This statement holds true if the perfect crystal has only one state with minimum energy.

Third Law Of Thermodynamics Examples:
Let us consider steam as an example to understand the third law of thermodynamics step by step:

The molecules within it move freely and have high entropy.
If one decreases the temperature below 100 °C, the steam gets converted to water, where the movement of molecules is restricted, decreasing the entropy of water.
When water is further cooled below 0 °C, it gets converted to solid ice. In this state, the movement of molecules is further restricted and the entropy of the system reduces more.
As the temperature of the ice further reduces, the movement of the molecules in them is restricted further and the entropy of the substance goes on decreasing.
When the ice is cooled to absolute zero, ideally, the entropy should be zero. But in reality, it is impossible to cool any substance to zero.

Thermodynamics Examples in Daily Life
Whether we are sitting in an air-conditioned room or travelling in any vehicle, the application of thermodynamics is everywhere. We have listed a few of these applications below:

Different types of vehicles such as planes, trucks and ships work on the basis of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
The three modes of heat transfer work on the basis of thermodynamics. The heat transfer concepts are widely used in radiators, heaters and coolers.
Thermodynamics is involved in the study of different types of power plants such as nuclear power plants, thermal power plants.
Thermodynamics – Summary and Overview
→ In simple terms, thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy from one form to another.
→ The laws of thermodynamics are:

First law of thermodynamics: Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another.

,,,Oscillations,"What Is Oscillation?
Oscillation is defined as the process of repeating variations of any quantity or measure about its equilibrium value in time. Oscillation can also be defined as a periodic variation of a matter between two values or about its central value.

The term vibration is used to describe the mechanical oscillations of an object. However, oscillations also occur in dynamic systems or, more accurately, in every field of science. Even the beating of our hearts creates oscillations. Objects that show motion around an equilibrium point are known as oscillators.

Examples of Oscillations
The most common examples of oscillation are the tides in the sea and the movement of a simple pendulum in a clock. Another example of oscillation is the movement of spring. The vibration of strings in guitars and other string instruments are also examples of oscillations.

The pendulum moves back and forth, and hence it creates an oscillating movement. Mechanical oscillations are called vibrations. A particle being vibrated means it oscillates between two points about its central point.

Likewise, the movement of spring is also an example of oscillation. The spring moves downward and then upward repeatedly, and hence it produces an oscillating movement.

A sine wave is a perfect example of oscillation. Here, the wave moves between two points about a central value. The height or the maximum distance that the oscillation takes place is called the amplitude, and the time taken to complete one complete cycle is called the time period of the oscillation. Frequency is the number of complete cycles that occur in a second. Frequency is the reciprocal of the time period.

F = 1 / T

Where F is the frequency of oscillation

And T is the time period of the oscillation

Oscillation Motion
In simple terms, we can say that when an object is swinging from side to side in a mechanical system, this movement can be termed an oscillation motion. In this type of motion, the potential energy usually changes to kinetic energy. An oscillation motion consists of one complete cycle.

Oscillation Types
Here, we will look at the different types of oscillations.

Damped Oscillations
Damping is the process of restraining or controlling the oscillatory motion, such as mechanical vibrations, by the dissipation of energy. An oscillation remains undamped when a restoring force equal to the restraining for is induced, and hence the system oscillates with the same energy. When the restoring force is not applied, the oscillation suddenly stops. And when the restoring force applied is less than​ the restraining force, damping is introduced.

Damped oscillations are classified according to the difference in energy between the restoring force applied and the restraining force acting. A damped oscillation is an oscillation which fades away with respect to time, that is, the oscillations which reduce in magnitude with time.

Also Read: Wave Motion

An ideal oscillating system is not a damped oscillation. In an ideal case, the magnitude of the oscillations does not reduce with time, and the amplitude remains the same. Suppose a child is swinging in a swing; unless the swing is being pumped by another child or any external force, the motion of the swing fades, and slowly the swing stops. This process is due to the damping of the swing.

● Shock absorbers in vehicles are examples of damping devices that reduce the vibration of the vehicle.

An image showing damped oscillation is given below:

Damped oscillation

 

In the above figure, the amplitude of the wave is diminished with time. The amplitude of the wave gets reduced, and such oscillations are called damped oscillations.

Different Types of Damped Oscillations
Damped oscillations can mainly be classified into three types:

Underdamped oscillations: Damping constant <1
Critically-damped oscillations: Damping constant = 1
Overdamped oscillations: Damping constant >1
 

Graph showing various damping system 

A graph showing various damping systems is shown above, and the three types of damping systems are discussed below.

Under Damped Oscillations
An underdamped oscillation reaches the zero value or the equilibrium point faster but oscillations occur across the equilibrium point one or more time. In underdamped oscillations, the damping constant is less than one.

In underdamped oscillations, the oscillation becomes stable very slowly. Under damped oscillations have least energy dissipation compared to other damping systems.

Critically Damped Oscillations
Critically damping is the damping in which the damping of the oscillation causes it to return to its equilibrium point fast and does not create any oscillations back and forth about that point. Critical damping is the damping in which the damping constant is equal to one.

Critical damping is the precise damping required for a system. In critical damping, the damping applied is such that the force available is just sufficient to bring the oscillation into equilibrium without any further back-and-forth movement (oscillations).

Also Read: LC Oscillations

Overdamped Oscillations
The damping in which the oscillations reach the equilibrium point slowly and do not create any oscillations across the equilibrium point is termed overdamped oscillation. In overdamped oscillations, the damping constant is greater than one. Overdamped oscillations have higher energy dissipation compared with other damping systems.

In overdamped oscillations, the damping applied is more than the required value of damping in order to bring the oscillations into rest or equilibrium point, and hence the oscillations reach the equilibrium point very slowly compared with other damping methods. In this system, no further back-and-forth movement will occur across the equilibrium point.

Undamped Oscillations
An undamped oscillation is an oscillation in which, when displaced from its equilibrium point, experiences a restoring force which is proportional to the displacement. So, in the undamped oscillation system, the magnitude of the oscillations never fades, and the magnitude of the oscillation remains the same. An example of undamped oscillation is alternating current (AC wave)

The magnitude of alternating current oscillates between two values across the equilibrium value, repeatedly and without any change in magnitude or time period. In alternating currents, no restraining force acts, and the magnitude of the signal does not fade with respect to time and keeps maintaining the same amplitude.",,,,,
,,,Superposition of Waves,"What Is the Superposition of Waves?
According to the principle of superposition, the resultant displacement of a number of waves in a medium at a particular point is the vector sum of the individual displacements produced by each of the waves at that point.

Superposition of waves 1

Principle of Superposition of Waves
Consider two waves travelling simultaneously along the same stretched string in opposite directions, as shown in the figure above. We can see images of waveforms in the string at each instant of time. It is observed that the net displacement of any element of the string at a given time is the algebraic sum of the displacements due to each wave.

Let us say two waves are travelling alone, and the displacements of any element of these two waves can be represented by y1(x, t) and y2(x, t). When these two waves overlap, the resultant displacement can be given as y(x,t).

Mathematically, y (x, t) = y1(x, t) + y2(x, t).

As per the principle of superposition, we can add the overlapped waves algebraically to produce a resultant wave. Let us say the wave functions of the moving waves are

y1 = f1(x–vt),

y2 = f2(x–vt)

……….

yn = fn (x–vt)

Then, the wave function describing the disturbance in the medium can be described as,

y = f1(x – vt)+ f2(x – vt)+ …+ fn(x – vt)

or, y=∑ i=1 to n = fi (x−vt)

Let us consider a wave travelling along a stretched string given by, y1(x, t) = A sin (kx – ωt) and another wave, shifted from the first by a phase φ, given as y2(x, t) = A sin (kx – ωt + φ)

From the equations, we can see that both the waves have the same angular frequency, the same angular wave number k, and hence the same wavelength and the same amplitude A.

Now, applying the superposition principle, the resultant wave is the algebraic sum of the two constituent waves and has displacement y(x, t) = A sin (kx – ωt) + A sin (kx – ωt + φ).

The above equation can be written as,

y(x, t) = 2A cos (ϕ/2). sin (kx − ωt + ϕ/2)

The resultant wave is a sinusoidal wave, travelling in the positive X direction, where the phase angle is half of the phase difference of the individual waves and the amplitude as [2cos ϕ/2] times the amplitudes of the original waves.

What Is Interference of Light?
The phenomena of formation of maximum intensity at some points and minimum intensity at some other point when two (or) more waves of equal frequency having constant phase difference arrive at a point simultaneously, superimpose with each other, is known as interference.

Types of Superposition of Waves
According to the phase difference in superimposing waves, interference is divided into two categories as follows.

Constructive Interference
If two waves superimpose with each other in the same phase, the amplitude of the resultant is equal to the sum of the amplitudes of individual waves resulting in the maximum intensity of light; this is known as constructive interference.

Destructive Interference
If two waves superimpose with each other in opposite phases, the amplitude of the resultant is equal to the difference in amplitude of individual waves, resulting in the minimum intensity of light; this is known as destructive interference.

Resultant Intensity in Interference of Two Waves
Let two waves of vertical displacements, y1 and y2, superimpose at a point p in space, as shown in the figure, then the resultant displacement is given by

superposition of waves 2

y = y1 + y2

Waves meet at some point p, and at the same time, the only difference occurs in their phases. Displacements of individual waves are given by

y1 = a sin ωt

y2 = b sin ( ωt + φ)

Where, a and b are their respective amplitudes, and Φ is the constant phase difference between the two waves.

Applying the superposition principle as stated above, we get

y = a sin ωt + b sin (ωt + θ) . . . . . . . . . . (1)

Representing equation 1 in the phasor diagram,

Superposition of waves 3

The resultant having an amplitude A and a phase angle with respect to wave —1

y = A sin(ωt + θ)

A sin(ωt + θ) = a sin ωt + b sin (ωt + θ)
For destructive interference, intensity should be minimum I = Imin, which happens only when cos φ = -1

When cos φ = -1

φ = π , 3π, 5π, . . . . . .

⇒ φ = (2n – 1)π, when n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . . .

Of Δx is the path difference between the waves at point p.
Condition for Destructive Interference
Phase difference = (2n – 1)π

Path difference = (2n – 1)λ/2

,,,Wave Optics,"Wave Optics Theories
Wave optics stands as a witness to a famous standoff between two great scientific communities who dedicated their lives to understanding the nature of light. One supports the particle nature of light, and the other supports the wave nature.

Sir Isaac Newton stands as a prominent figure who supported the voice of the particle nature of light; he proposed a corpuscular theory, which states that “light consists of extremely light and tiny particles known as corpuscles which travel with very high speeds from the source of light to create a sensation of vision by reflecting on the retina of the eye”.

Using this theory, Newton was able to explain reflection and refraction but failed to explain the cause of interference, diffraction and polarization. The major failure of Newton’s corpuscular theory was that it could not explain why the velocity of light was lesser in the denser medium compared to the vacuum.

Huygens Wave Theory
No one dared to challenge Newton’s corpuscular theory until Christopher Huygens proposed his wave theory of light in the early 18th century. According to Huygens’s theory, light consists of waves that travel through a very dilute and highly elastic material medium present everywhere in space”. This medium is called ether.

As the medium is supposed to be very dilute and highly elastic, its density would be very low, and the modulus of elasticity would be very high so that the speed of the light would be very large.

Huygens’s wave theory explained phenomena like reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction of light. But failed to explain the following:

Polarization, as Huygens assumed that light waves, which are longitudinal in nature, are mechanical disturbances.
Black body radiation, photoelectric effect and Compton effect.
Hypothetical medium ether was never discovered, and now we know light can propagate in a vacuum.

According to Maxwell, light is not a mechanical wave. It is an electromagnetic wave which is transverse in nature and travels with a finite speed, given by,

 
 
μo is the permeability = 4π x 10-7

εo is the permittivity = 8.854 x 10-12

Wavefront and Wave Normal
What Is Wavefront?
A wavefront is defined as the locus of all points of the medium which vibrate in the same phase. Depending on the shape of the source of light, wavefronts can be of three types.

Spherical Wave Front
When light emerges from a point source, the wavefronts are spherical in shape.

Spherical Wave Front

 

In spherical wavefront,

Amplitude of light waves,

 
 
And, Intensity of light waves,

 
 
Cylindrical Wave Front
When the source of light is linear, the wavefronts are cylindrical in shape. All the points are equidistant from the source.

Cylindrical Wave Front

 

In this case, the amplitude of light waves is

 
 
Intensity of light waves is

 
 
Plane Wave Front
When the light is coming from a very far-off source, the wavefronts are planar. For a plane wavefront, the amplitude remains constant; therefore, the intensity remains constant.

What Is Wave Normal?
A perpendicular drawn to the surface of a wavefront at any point in the direction of propagation of light is called “wave normal”. The direction in which light travels is called a ‘ray’ of light. Thus, a wave normal is the same as a ray of light.

Shape of Wavefronts
A lens can be used to change the shape of wavefronts. The concept of wavefronts for reflection and refraction is explained below.

Wavefronts for Reflection
If light falls on a plane mirror
If the plane wavefronts are being reflected on the plane mirror, the shape of the wavefront of the reflected light is again planar.

Wavefronts For Reflection

 

If light falls on a concave mirror
If a plane wavefront falls on a concave mirror, the shape of the reflected light is spherical.

Plane wavefront falling on a concave mirror

If light falls on a convex mirror
If a plane wavefront falls on a convex mirror, the shape of the reflected light is spherical.

A wavefront is represented by the plane

 
. Find the direction of the propagation of the wave.
Solution: Given,

 
which is a straight-line equation. So, the wavefront can be represented as a straight line having a slope
 
As it has a negative slope, the wavefront is represented like

Wavefront in negative slope

 

 

∴ Wavefront makes an angle of 150° with the x-axis. As the wave must be perpendicular to the wavefront, it will make an angle of 60° with the x-axis.

Huygen’s Principle
According to Huygen’s principle, every point on a given wavefront can be regarded as a fresh source of new disturbance and sends out its own spherical wavelets called secondary wavelets. These secondary wavelets spread out in all directions with the velocity of the wave.

A surface touching these secondary wavelets tangentially in the forward direction at any instant (Δt) gives the position and shape of the new wavefront at the instant. This is called “secondary wavefront”.

Huygen’s Principle

 

As discussed in the introduction, Huygen’s principle of secondary wavelets could explain many optical phenomena like reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction. Still, it could not explain why wavefronts of secondary wavelets are formed in the forward direction and not in the backward direction.

Interference of Light
The effect of non-uniform energy distribution in the medium due to two superimposed light waves is called interference.

Coherent and Incoherent Sources
Coherent Source: Two sources that emit a monochromatic light continuously with a zero (or) constant phase difference between them are called coherent sources.

Incoherent Source: The sources which do not emit light with constant phase difference are called incoherent sources.","Pusa Sawani, Pusa A-4 of Okra (Bhindi)",Fruit and shoot borer,,,

The study of stationary electric charges at rest is known as electrostatics. An electroscope is used to detect the charge on a body. A pith ball electroscope is used to detect a charge and to know the nature of the charge.

Conductors, Insulators, and Semiconductors
A body in which electric charge can easily flow through is called a conductor (For example, metals).
A body in which electric charge cannot flow is called an insulator or dielectric. (For example, glass, wool, rubber, plastic, etc.)
Substances which are intermediate between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors. (For example, silicon, germanium, etc.)
Dielectric Strength: It is the minimum field intensity that should be applied to break down the insulating property of the insulator.

Dielectric strength of air = 3 x 106 V/m
Dielectric strength of Teflon = 60 × 106 Vm–1
The maximum charge a sphere can hold depends on the size and dielectric strength of the medium in which the sphere is placed.

The maximum charge density of a sphere of radius ‘R’ in terms of electric intensity E at a distance in free space is Eε0(R/r)2.
When the electric field in the air exceeds its dielectric strength, air molecules become ionised and are accelerated by fields and the air becomes conducting.

Surface Charge Density σ
The charge per unit area of a conductor is defined as surface charge density.

 
 
 
. When A = 1 m2, then σ = q.
Its unit is coulomb/metre, and its dimensions are ATL–2. It is used in the formula for the charged disc, charged conductor, an infinite sheet of charge etc.  The surface charge density depends on the shape of the conductor and the presence of other conductors and insulators in the vicinity of the conductor.

Surface charge density

 

 
 
 
 
σ is maximum at pointed surfaces, and for plane surfaces, it is minimum.
Surface charge density is maximum at the corners of rectangular laminas and at the vertex of the conical conductor.
Electric Flux
The number of electric lines of force crossing a surface normal to the area gives electric flux ΦE.

Electric Flux

 

The electric flux through an elementary area ds is defined as the scalar product of area and field.

dΦE = Eds cos θ

Or,

 
Electric Flux will be maximum when the electric field is normal to the area (dΦ = Eds)
Electric Flux will be minimum when the field is parallel to the area (dΦ = 0)
For a closed surface, outward flux is positive and inward flux is negative
Electric Potential (V)
The electric potential at a point in a field is the amount of work done in bringing a unit +ve charge from infinity to the point. It is equal to the electric potential energy of unit + ve charge at that point.

It is a scalar quantity.
The SI unit is volts.
The electric potential at a distance ‘d’ due to a point charge q in air or vacuum is

 
 
 
Electric potential (V)

 
 
 
(or) V = Ed
A positive charge in a field moves from high potential to low potential, whereas an electron moves from low potential to high potential when left free. Work done in moving a charge q through a potential difference V is W = q V joule

Equipotential Surface
A surface on which all points are at the same potential is called an equipotential surface.

The electric field is perpendicular to the equipotential surface.
Work done in moving a charge on the equipotential surface is zero.

In the Case of Solid Charged Sphere
The potential at any point inside the sphere is the same as that at any point on its surface.

 
 
 
It is an equipotential surface. Outside the sphere, the potential varies inversely as the distance of the point from the centre.

 

 
 
 
Note: Inside a non-conducting charged sphere electric field is present.

Electric intensity inside the sphere

 
 
 
Here, d is the distance from the centre of the sphere and E ∝ d is inside the sphere but falls off like 1/d2 outside the sphere.

This is the unit of energy in particle physics and is represented as eV.

1 eV = 1.602 x 10‑19 J.

Electric Dipole
Two equal and opposite charges separated by a constant distance is called an electric dipole.

 
Dipole Moment
It is the product of one of the charges and the distance between the charges. It is a vector directed from the negative charge towards the positive charge along the line joining the two charges.

The torque acting on an electric dipole placed in a uniform electric field is given by the relation,

 
 
⇒ The electric intensity (E) on the axial line at a distance’d’ from the center of an electric dipole is

 
 
 
and on equatorial line, the electric intensity (E)
 
 
 
.
⇒ For a short dipole, i.e., if l2 << d2, then the electric intensity on the equatorial line is given by

 
 
 
.
⇒ The potential due to an electric dipole on the axial line is

 
 
 
, and at any point on the equatorial line, it is zero.
When two unlike equal charges, +Q and –Q, are separated by a distance

The net electric potential is zero on the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the charges.
The bisector is an equipotential and zero potential line.
Work done in moving a charge on this line is zero.
Electric intensity at any point on the bisector is perpendicular to the bisector.
Electric intensity at any point on the bisector parallel to the bisector is zero.
Combined Field Due to Two Point Charges

Due to two similar charges zero potential point is not formed.

Electric Lines of Force
The line of force is the path along which a unit +ve charge accelerates in the electric field. The tangent at any point to the line of force gives the direction of the field at that point.

Properties of Electric Lines of Force
Two lines of force never intersect.
The number of lines of force passing normally through a unit area around a point is numerically equal to E, the strength of the field at the point.
Lines of force always leave or end normally on a charged conductor.
Electric lines of force can never be closed loops.
Lines of force have a tendency to contract longitudinally and exert a force of repulsion on one another laterally.
If in a region of space, there is no electric field, there will be no lines of force. Inside a conductor, there cannot be any line of force.
The number of lines of force passing normally through a unit area around a point is numerically equal to E.

Uniform field

 

In a uniform field, lines of force are parallel to one another.

Non uniform magnetic field

Difference between electric lines of force and magnetic lines of force

Electric lines of force never form closed loops, while magnetic lines are always closed loops.
